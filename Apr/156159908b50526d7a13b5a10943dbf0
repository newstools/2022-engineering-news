The government of eSwatini and airline Airlink have decided to call it quits on their joint venture Eswatini Airlink, which will cease operations from June 1. Eswatini Airlink currently operates multiple daily flights between Johannesburg and the Sikhuphe’s King Mswati III International Airport. “Through our jointly owned and operated Eswatini Airlink businesses, we have enjoyed a long and mutually successful partnership connecting eSwatini to the world, particularly through the OR Tambo International Airport, in Johannesburg. “However, as the government of eSwatini recently re-established a national airline, we have amicably agreed to discontinue Airlink’s operations in an orderly manner. We are offering to re-employ every staff member with Airlink, thereby securing their jobs,” explains Airlink CEO Rodger Foster. Eswatini Airlink has been providing air services for 23 years, after Royal Swazi National Airways stopped operating. eSwatini Public Works and Transport Minister Ndlaluhlaza Ndwandwe comments that the country will take advantage of the opportunity that the post-Covid-19 restart and recovery presents, to launch a new State-owned carrier, and usher in a new era of competition. From June 1, South Africa-based Airlink and the new carrier, Eswatini Air, will respectively provide scheduled air services between Johannesburg and King Mswati Airport, giving customers greater choice.
