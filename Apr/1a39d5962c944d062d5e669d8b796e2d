KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala has asked the national government to waive the toll fees on major transport routes in KwaZulu-Natal. Many roads in the province were damaged or washed away by the recent floods, leaving road users to pay toll fees to use the only alternative route – the N2 at uThongathi Toll Plaza and the Umvoti Toll Plaza. “The public transport industry operating in these areas service the travel needs of a large number of residents from numerous communities, particularly in areas along the R102 on route to industries. "The industry is under pressure to bear the excessive costs of toll fees in addition to facing longer trips. These costs are bound to be passed on to commuters through higher taxi fares. The trucking industry is also facing additional demands as a result of post-disaster recovery efforts throughout KwaZulu-Natal. “The absence on non-levied routes presents a threat to the industry’s dwindling profit margins and poor turnaround times due to excessive traffic and resultant delays,” the Premier says.
