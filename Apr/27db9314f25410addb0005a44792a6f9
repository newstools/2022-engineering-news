The deployment of the 2Africa subsea cable system remains on track for completion in 2024 as it completes the first landing in Genoa, Italy. Vodafone, the 2Africa landing party in Genoa, partnered with Equinix to land the cable directly into the Equinix Carrier Neutral Data Centers (CNDC), with Retelit delivering the fronthaul. The 2Africa consortium, working with a local Italian operator, has also developed a new terrestrial route connecting the Genoa cable landing station directly to major CNDCs in Milan. Capacity will be available to service providers in Genoa on a fair and equitable basis, encouraging and supporting the development of a healthy Internet ecosystem. “The landing sets the tone for more landings in the coming months as the cable is extended to a total of 46 locations by the completion of the project in 2024,” the 2Africa consortium said in a joint statement. The 2Africa consortium comprises China Mobile International, Vodafone, WIOCC, Orange, Meta, MTN GlobalConnect, stc and Telecom Egypt. The project, launched in May 2020, aims to deliver seamless international connectivity to about three-billion people, accounting for 36% of the global population, and connecting three continents, namely Africa, Europe and Asia. The 45 000 km subsea cable will be the longest subsea cable deployed. Good progress on the survey work and manufacturing continues with the 2Africa project remaining on track for completion in 2024.
