Financial services provider First National Bank (FNB) has pledged R7.5-million to the KwaZulu-Natal government, as part of efforts to support in the provision of necessities such as shelter, food, medical assistance and hygiene supplies to communities that have been impacted by the floods in the province. FNB is also leveraging its digital platform to enable clients and employees to donate money and eBucks to charitable causes through nav» Care on the FNB App. FNB spokesperson Themba Msimango says flood-related insurance claims for individuals and business clients who have insurance with the bank would also be expedited. "To ensure the continued availability of our banking services in KwaZulu-Natal, we have accelerated the restoration of our infrastructure that was damaged by the floods." Currently, about 98% of FNB branches and 95% of FNB automated teller machines, or ATMs, in KwaZulu-Natal have been restored. "We continue to assess the need for mobile banking solutions in communities where infrastructure restoration may take longer than anticipated," Msimango notes.
