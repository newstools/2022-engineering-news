Toyota South Africa Motors (TSAM) says it has suffered “extensive damage” at its Prospecton assembly plant, in KwaZulu-Natal, owing to widespread flooding in the coastal province in the past week. The local arm of the Japanese manufacturer adds, however, that the extent of the impact cannot yet be quantified. “No injuries were reported on site.” TSAM says the plant remains shuttered, but notes that mop-up operations have already started. “TSAM is working to recoup the lost time, as well as to mitigate, as much as possible, the knock-on effect of delays arising from this unfortunate situation.” TSAM produces the Corolla Cross, Fortuner, Hiace Ses’fikile minibus and Hilux bakkie for the local market, while some models are also exported. The Prospecton operation also hosts the Hino truck assembly plant. Toyota is the sales leader in the local market, and the Hilux the country’s best-selling vehicle.
