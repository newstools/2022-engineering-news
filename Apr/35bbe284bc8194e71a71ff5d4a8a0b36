Suzuki Auto South Africa (SASA) has set yet another all-time sales record as 3 347 units changed hands in March for a near 10% share of the local passenger vehicle market. The Japanese importer also exported 17 units. This is the fifth time in seven months that Suzuki managed to sell more than 3 000 units. SASA’s dealer network also set its own record, selling 2 933 units in March. Suzuki last month also welcomed its eightieth dealer. “The interest from investors who would like to open a Suzuki dealership is at an all-time high and enquiries for new Suzuki dealerships continue to stream in,” says SASA auto dealer sales manager Henno Havenga. “We will continue to expand our network, but will do so in a responsible way to ensure that all our dealers stay profitable and offer the high level of customer service that we have become known for.” SASA reports that it ended its financial year with total sales of 31 048 units, up 69% on the previous reporting period. “The [auto] industry is acutely aware of the economic pressure that the average South African motorist is facing,” notes SASA brand marketing manager Brendon Carpenter. “Fuel prices keep rising, food and housing inflation is growing, and many people are still trying to recover from the economic impact of the last two years. “That is one of the reasons why Suzuki has focused relentlessly on providing cost-effective solutions,” says Carpenter. “Whether it is the new Celerio, with one of the lowest average fuel consumption figures in the country, or the Super Carry, which helps entrepreneurs move their goods at the best possible cost-per-kilometre, we are working hard to make motoring both fun and affordable.”
