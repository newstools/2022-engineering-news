Chemicals and energy company Sasol has joined an international consortium of industrial and academic project partners, known as Concrete Chemicals, in an effort to combine its technical knowledge with cement producer Cemex and renewable energy company Enertrag. Concrete Chemicals is focussed on climate-neutral cement production by converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by using hydrogen, thereby presenting an opportunity for CO2 reduction in both sectors. Sasol’s new business unit Sasol ecoFT, Cemex and Enertrag will combine their technical know-how in Germany, whereby Sasol ecoFT will contribute its Fischer-Tropsch technology to produce synthetic and SAF, while Enertrag will produce green hydrogen exclusively with energy from regional wind and solar plants. Cemex will provide another raw material for SAF production by capturing CO2 generated during cement production. To implement the project, the consortium is preparing European-level funding applications. Sasol ecoFT senior VP Dr Helge Sachs says the company, in its first large-scale joint venture, “looks forward to contribute to decarbonising aviation with our cutting-edge Fischer-Tropsch technology and fulfilling our purpose of innovating for a better world through Sasol’s new business unit Sasol ecoFT.”
