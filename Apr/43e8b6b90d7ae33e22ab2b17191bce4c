Power utility Eskom has announced that it has established a project team, supported by its internal and external lawyers, to review the report issued by the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture and to ensure appropriate actions are taken to address the recommendations made in the report. The Presidency on April 29 received the fourth part of the report, with two of the four volumes related to Eskom. Eskom is studying the report to identify whether there are implicated individuals still in its employ and will take appropriate action as required in line with its policies, it has assured the public. This is in addition to the numerous criminal cases registered with the South African Police Service over the years and disciplinary action taken against its employees implicated in the irregularities. “State Capture and its agents caused immense harm to Eskom over many years. We view the release of the commission’s report as an important step to ensure that more of those who undermined Eskom are brought to book, and we look forward to working with the National Prosecuting Authority to ensure that the miscreants speedily face criminal charges," Eskom chairperson Professor Malegapuru Makgoba says. Among the recommendations made by the commission are that the 2014 Eskom board should face criminal prosecution.
