The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) is keeping a close watch on the water levels of two dams in KwaZulu-Natal after the heavy rains and floods. The DWS is monitoring the Ntshingwayo dam, near Newcastle, which is currently at 82% of capacity in line with the 80% operating rule. The release from the dam now is at 23.43 cumecs and downstream communities have been informed accordingly. The second dam is the Pongolapoort dam, known as Jozini dam, which is currently at 86%. “According to the 85% operating rule for the dam, the DWS should be releasing 38 mᶟ/s but 20 mᶟ/s is being released currently,” the department commented, noting that the lower release is to allow for the security of the infrastructure and for communication to communities downstream. “Communication to communities downstream is essential as it ensures the protection of lives and livelihoods. Once that communication is done, there is a possibility of the release from Pongolapoort dam to be raised to the required 38 cumecs,” DWS said.
