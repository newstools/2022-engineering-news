Nissan has unveiled its prototype production facility for laminated all-solid-state battery cells, which the company aims to bring to market in 2028. This prototype facility, located within the Nissan Research Centre in the Kanagawa Prefecture, aims to further promote the development of all-solid-state batteries, as the next step in electric vehicle (EV) evolution. Under its long-term vision, Nissan Ambition 2030, Nissan aims to launch an EV with all-solid-state batteries developed in-house by fiscal year 2028. It plans to establish a pilot production line at its Yokohama assembly plant in fiscal year 2024, with the materials, design and manufacturing processes for production on the line to be studied at the prototype production facility. The Japanese auto maker says it believes all-solid-state batteries can be reduced to $75 per kWh in fiscal year 2028, and to $65 per kWh thereafter, placing EVs at the same cost level as petrol-powered vehicles. All-solid-state batteries are expected to be a game-changing technology for accelerating the popularity of EVs, notes Nissan. “They have an energy density about twice that of conventional lithium-ion batteries, significantly shorter charging time due to superior charge/discharge performance, and lower cost thanks to the opportunity of using less expensive materials. “With these benefits, Nissan expects to use all-solid-state batteries in a wide range of vehicle segments, including pickup trucks, making its EVs more competitive.”
