The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) says it is prioritising the repair of four sinkholes along John and Webber streets, near Booysens road, in Selby, Johannesburg, that developed as a result of illegal mining activities in the vicinity. Repairs to damaged stormwater infrastructure and road surfaces are currently under way. The sinkholes have been identified and barricaded. “A standby team was assigned to barricade two large, dangerous holes located on John street and will continue to monitor the site until the completion of repairs,” the agency says. “Motorists are advised to approach the affected streets with caution, especially at night,” the JRA warns. The agency again highlights the scourge of vandalism to public infrastructure and the damage to road assets owing to illegal mining activities. It also warns that the removal and theft of traffic lights infrastructure poses major safety hazards to road users, noting instances of serious injuries and fatalities as a result. “The JRA will intensify efforts by further partnering with security companies, resident associations, community safety forums and law enforcement agencies to address the spate of theft and vandalism of road infrastructure. “Community members can report such illegal activities to the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department on 011 375 5911.” Further, the JRA team will carry out more repairs in the Selby precinct and will communicate a detailed plan for repairing the sinkholes in this area in due course, the agency says.
