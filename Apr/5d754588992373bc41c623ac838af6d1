The Western Cape government has welcomed the approval for Delta Air Lines to fly a triangular route between Atlanta, in the US, and Johannesburg and Cape Town. Government entities granted the approval following extensive correspondence and an intergovernmental dispute process relating to how foreign operator permit applications are processed. 'We regard the approval of Delta Air Lines’ application to fly a triangular route between Atlanta, Johannesburg and Cape Town as a big win and we will continue to work hard to expand 'air access' because more flights means more tourists and more tourists means more jobs in the Western Cape. "We remain committed to increasing investment, expanding trade and scaling up tourism with the US, so we look forward to finally welcoming Delta Air Lines to the Western Cape," Premier Alan Winde comments.
