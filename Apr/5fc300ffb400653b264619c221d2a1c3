Western Cape Agriculture Minister Dr Ivan Meyer has welcomed the R170-million investment by Flemish biscuit company Lotus, which has started building a factory, in Wolseley, in the Western Cape. Lotus' best-known product is Speculoos, a spiced shortcrust biscuit marketed abroad as Biscoff. However, at an existing factory at Wolseley, Lotus produces healthy snacks in the shape of fruit rolls sold under the Bear's brand name. "The investment by Lotus . . . will positively impact the economy and jobs within Wolseley and the greater Witzenberg region. “The agricultural value chain creates jobs in rural and peri-urban regions with higher unemployment rates than cities. Investments such as these promise more jobs and prosperity to rural communities," Meyer comments. Lotus Manufacturing South Africa MD Donald Matheson says the story of Lotus South Africa was one of meteoric success. “We opened our first plant in 2019, the second in 2021, and by August 2023, we will open the third plant. During this period, production has jumped from 1 800 t of product in 2019 to about 3 100 t. "At the same time, jobs have increased from 293 to 527," he points out.
