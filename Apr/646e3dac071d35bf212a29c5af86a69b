Transnet Pipelines has reported an attempted fuel theft incident, which has resulted in the death of one person. The State-owned entity reports that it activated its emergency response plan in the early hours of April 6, when the National Operating Centre detected a loss in pressure on the Kendal to Waltloo petroleum pipeline. Security teams were activated immediately and discovered tampering at the block valve chamber with an unidentified deceased person inside, the company says, noting that the incident was accordingly reported to the authorities and an inquest docket has been opened. The incident is currently under investigation. “This incident is a harsh reminder to perpetrators of the dangers associated with tampering with the high pressure petroleum pipelines and its infrastructure. Their actions have resulted in fatalities, serious injuries, fire, explosions, environmental damage and other asset damage. “This gruesome death brings the total number of fatalities to seven over the past three years. Should the criminal activities continue, more people could die,” Transnet Pipelines warns. It has appealed to all residents living near its pipelines or driving past to report any suspicious activities near its infrastructure on the toll free number: 0800 203 843.
