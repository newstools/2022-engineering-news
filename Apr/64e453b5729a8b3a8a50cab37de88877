Petroleum producer bp Southern Africa (bpSA), through its ongoing partnership with the Solidarity Fund, is donating R8-million to help support relief efforts in KwaZulu-Natal following severe and widespread destruction in the province as a result of the cut-off low weather phenomenon of April 12. The donation will provide displaced flood victims with food, water and other essential emergency supplies, while the parties involved are in the process of finalising the project plan and the monitoring and evaluation aspects linked to the plan. bpSA CEO Taelo Mojapelo says the health, safety and security of South Africans and the environment are “core bp values” and that the company is grateful for the “exceptional leadership” of bpSA board chairperson Advocate Thandi Orleyn, as her support made this donation possible. “The Solidarity Fund is a rapid response vehicle through which pooled contributions can be deployed to immediately fund impactful initiatives in times of need. Solidarity Fund floods response adviser Martin Kingston says the solidarity and support shown by organisations such as bpSA in support of the floods response is crucial in assisting and enabling the Fund to provide urgent humanitarian aid at a time when it is critically required. Following the floods, bpSA’s immediate priority was to account for all its employees and provide essential survival packs, including food, water and hygiene essentials for them. “Our emergency response team also continues to support our colleagues and impacted retail sites,” says Mojapelo.
