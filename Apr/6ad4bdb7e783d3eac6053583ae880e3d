Eskom has announced that load-shedding has immediately jumped to Stage 4 on Tuesday morning after more generation units failed. The power utility said the jump from Stage 2 happened at 7:20 after Majuba Unit 5 and Tutuka Unit 4 tripped. Eskom did not say when the load-shedding will end. A statement is expected to be released soon with more details. CEO Andre de Ruyter is also scheduled to brief the media at 10:00 on the state of the grid. Eskom initially started with overnight Stage 2 load-shedding early last week, before more unit failures at various power stations led to full-time shedding until Friday morning. There was a slight reprieve until Sunday, when Stage 2 was needed again.
