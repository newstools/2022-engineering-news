The first drops of Phase 3 of the Nooitgedacht Water Scheme were delivered on March 31, marking the last step in finishing the project that is meant to augment water supply to the Nelson Mandela metropolitan and surrounds. The metropolitan has, over the past few years, carried out the planning, design, tender preparation, contract administration and contract supervision for the augmentation of the Nooitgedacht supply scheme, which was first commissioned in 1993 with a capacity of 70 ml/day. The project completion date was initially set for June 2021 and later moved to September 2021, but has faced delays owing to budget constraints and contractual matters, which have since been resolved. For the third phase of the project, the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) intervened and appointed the Amatola Water Board as an implementing agent. “During the working session in the province last year in August, Water and Sanitation Minister Senzo Mchunu was requested by former Mayors and later by the business sector to intervene for the completion of the project to be realised,” the DWS said in a statement on April 1. On March 29, the contractor conducted a water supply shutdown to carry out the final connection for Phase 3. The connection work was a success, and currently Nooitgedacht Water Treatment Works is delivering about 190 ml/d of water, of which 70 ml/d is being transferred through the Stanford Road Booster Pump Station to the Western areas.
