Integrated mobility solutions company CFAO South Africa has acquired material handling and warehousing equipment supplier EIE Group, which will be known as CFAO Equipment South Africa, with effect from April 1. The venture will be beneficial for both companies, extending CFAO South Africa’s market offerings to include the supply of material handling and warehouse equipment from reputable global manufacturers including Toyota Forklift, says CFAO South Africa CEO Andrew Velleman. “The acquisition of [EIE Group] by CFAO South Africa is an exciting opportunity to leverage the organisation’s extensive industry expertise. To be a part of CFAO South Africa will strengthen our position as the market leader in Southern Africa,” says EIE Group national sales manager Vuyokazi Bangazi. CFAO Equipment in South Africa will be part of a larger CFAO Equipment network across 34 countries in Africa, and will add an additional pillar to the CFAO South Africa Group. “I am proud that we are integrating the network and expertise of such a reputable industrial equipment supplier into our business. We welcome to CFAO South Africa a workforce of more than 1 200 highly skilled members who share the same priority: to provide value to our customers and their operations,” says Velleman. “The evolution of the company to form CFAO Equipment will have no operational impact on our loyal customers, and we will continue to provide world-class products and services to the material handling and warehousing industry that we have become synonymous with. “CFAO South Africa remains committed to transformation and is planning a new broad-based black economic empowerment transaction for CFAO Equipment to retain the current transformation rating. “We look forward to this next step in the progression of our business and believe that this is only the beginning of a mutually rewarding relationship that will result in new levels of success,” concludes Velleman.
