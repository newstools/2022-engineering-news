The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) have opened two sluice gates at the Vaal dam, with a further three sluice gates set to be opened on Tuesday afternoon. The decision comes after a significant amount of inflows was experienced owing to recent rainfall. As of Tuesday morning, the inflows were at 1 065.67 m2/s, the DWS said in a statement. The Vaal now stands at 110.5%. The department said that there are further recommendations from the DWS hydrology experts to release water from the Bloemhof dam, which is currently at 106.9%. The discharge at the Bloemhof dam, which is downstream of the Vaal dam, was at 354.37 m2/s, increased to 500 m2/s at 10h00 on Tuesday and to be further increased to 600 m2/s on Tuesday afternoon. Meanwhile, with significant localised flooding currently in KwaZulu-Natal, a decision has been reached for Umgeni Water to release water from the Hazelmere dam, north of Durban. The level in the dam has overnight reached beyond 65% and will be reduced to 53%. The DWS said this is necessitated by the ongoing work to raise the dam wall, therefore the reduction to 53% or lower is a safety measure as work continues. DWS spokesperson Sputnik Ratau warned downstream communities about the imminent increase of outflow from the dams. “Residents are warned to steer clear of the dam areas. Communities with equipment in and near the dams are asked to remove them so as to ensure that no damage is caused,” said Ratau.
