Japanese vehicle manufacturer Nissan has ceased all production under the Datsun brand. While the Russian and Indonesian plants closed in 2020 already, production has now also stopped at the plant in India. Production of Datsun vehicles started in 1931, but was phased out in the 1980s, only to be revived in 2013 through a multimillion-dollar investment. The focus was on more affordable cars for developing markets, South Africa included. In South Africa, the brand included the GO and GO+ hatchback models. Nissan South Africa has confirmed that it no longer sells Datsun models locally.
