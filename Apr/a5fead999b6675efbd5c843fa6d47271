With thousands of people left without access to potable water, following the floods in KwaZulu-Natal earlier this month, condition monitoring specialists WearCheck are offering free borehole and other water testing for the next three months. Until mid-July, any businesses and individuals who need to check their water quality to ascertain whether it is safe for human consumption and general household use can drop off water samples at WearCheck’s laboratory in Westville, where they will undergo SANS 241 testing (drinking water safety) for free. This offer is valid for everyone in the affected areas, regardless of whether they are an existing WearCheck customer. “We are extending a sincere offer to help the affected communities around Durban, which stretch from Pietermaritzburg to the west, Tongaat to the north and Scottburgh to the south,” said WearCheck water testing division head Moses Lelaka, expressing concern at the potential for contamination in the water that people are currently drinking, which could lead to disease and even death if consumed. “Our water testing division is standing by to assist community members to stay safe and healthy in these trying times.” Water samples of around one litre, stored in a clean/sterile, well-sealed container, can be dropped off at WearCheck’s laboratory located at No 4 The Terrace, Westway Office Park, Westville, 3635.
