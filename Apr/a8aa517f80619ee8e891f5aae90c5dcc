JSE-listed freight and logistics group Grindrod says its container depots, terminals and warehouse facilities in and around central Durban have been heavily impacted by the recent floods in KwaZulu-Natal, with operations at five sites suspended – “and likely to be so for several weeks”. “We are grateful that all our staff, and our service providers’ staff, are accounted for and are safe,” notes the company. “The impact to Grindrod includes damage to equipment and infrastructure. “Activity to recover customer containers and restore facilities has commenced, in collaboration with our insurers,” says the company. “Whilst the floods have been devastating, our equipment and facilities that have been damaged are all insured, including cover for business interruption. “In addition, engagement with key customers is underway around contingencies, including those required for the upcoming citrus season.” Grindrod says it continues to take the necessary precautions in view of the heavy rains still being forecast over the next few days. “The safety of our staff is our main priority. The situation is challenging, and our solutions are evolving as we focus on supporting our people, our communities and our customers.” Force Majeure at Matola Terminal
Operations at Grindrod’s Matola terminal, at the Port of Maputo, in Mozambique, were also impacted this month when a force majeure was declared after a ship collision damaged port infrastructure at the terminal. “Discussions with the port authority and insurers are ongoing, and ship-loading operations are expected to commence this month,” notes the company.
