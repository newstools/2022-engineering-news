The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) on April 9 said that, while it had published a consultation paper on municipal guideline increase and tariff benchmarks for public comment last week, it has decided to hold a public hearing at a later date to give stakeholders a further opportunity to engage on the issues raised in the consultation paper. The energy regulator initially opted not to hold public hearings on the key issues reflected in the consultation paper on the municipal guideline increase and tariff benchmarks, and followed a notice and comment process owing to the fact that, in the past, few to no presenters attended the public hearings to make representations to Nersa, it said. “[Nersa] is required to approve the guideline increase and tariff benchmarks in time to allow municipalities to prepare tariff applications for consideration by Nersa. These approved tariffs, after consideration, are then used by municipalities to table their budgets to their respective councils. “Stakeholders have an opportunity to provide input on the consultation paper until April 22.” The reason for its decision to follow a public participation process is to ensure the final guideline increase and benchmarks are published by May 11, which will enable the municipal tariff process to be finalised for implementation by July 1. “Even though the process followed meets the legal requirements as set out in the [Promotion of Administrative Justice Act], Nersa has identified a number of stakeholders who requested that a public hearing be held on the matter,” it said. “Nersa remains committed to its regulatory principle of being transparent in its decision-making processes. Nersa assures all stakeholders and the public that its decisions are made in accordance with the law and in an effort to strike a fair balance between the interests of customers, end-users, licensees and investors in the electricity supply industry,” the regulator said.
