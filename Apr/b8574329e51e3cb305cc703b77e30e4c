Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says the Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) and the departments of Transport and Mineral Resources and Energy have been mandated to put measures in place to address the jet fuel shortage experienced at OR Tambo International Airport, in Johannesburg. The jet fuel shortage is the result of the floods in KwaZulu-Natal that affected transport infrastructure and disrupted supply chains, he says. "The jet fuel supply to OR Tambo International has now been stabilised. We also welcome the Notice to Airmen issued by ACSA, advising all airlines, both international and domestic, on measures being implemented to obviate disruptions to air services," Mbalula says. The aviation sector is a critical enabler of economic activity, which requires support in ensuring that it makes its contribution to economic recovery in the aftermath of the Covid-19 devastation, he adds. "We, therefore, wish to reassure the aviation sector that there is adequate fuel at OR Tambo International Airport and at all our national airports. ACSA is doing everything within its power, working closely with oil suppliers, to ensure there is adequate fuel stock at all times. "We further encourage the airlines to communicate with ACSA in order to clear up any uncertainty on this matter, rather than resorting to drastic measures such as cancelling flights. "Following my engagements with the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy [Gwede Mantashe], we are pleased that ACSA has worked tirelessly to resolve this challenge, working with relevant stakeholders and other organs of State," Mbalula said.
