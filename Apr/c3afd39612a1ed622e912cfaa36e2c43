The Public Investment Corporation (PIC) has appointed Kabelo Rikhotso as its new chief investment officer, effective May 10. Rikhotso will join the PIC from Visio Fund Management where he was an executive and fund manager. "With more than 18 years’ experience in the asset management industry, he is a dynamic leader and pioneer who founded the first black-owned investment firm, Royal Investment Managers, in March 2016," the PIC reports. At the PIC, Rikhotso will oversee the institution’s overall investment strategy; monitor and review all investment decisions; and develop the outlook and asset allocation function, in line with the investment mandates of the PIC’s clients. Mr Abel Sithole, the PIC’s chief executive officer, welcomed Rikhotso’s appointment: “We are confident that, with his experience, initially at the National Treasury and later at some of the country’s leading investment firms, Kabelo will bring new rigour to strengthen our executive team. His core function will be to sustain the PIC’s investment performance and to continue growing the portfolios of our clients," Sithole comments.
