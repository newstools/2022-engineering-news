The government of Botswana is, through its Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry, calling for expressions of interest from local and international companies with relevant experience in the manufacture of electric vehicles (EVs) and related components in Botswana. The government intends to partner with a company that will manufacture EVs and related components in Botswana to supply locally manufactured EVs for the local and regional market. "The expression of interest aims to develop the local electromobility industry to contribute towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to Botswana's other developmental objectives towards industry," the government says in an advertisement. Expressions of interest should be submitted to the Ministry by May 12.
