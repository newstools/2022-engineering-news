Business Against Crime South Africa (Bacsa) – a division of Business Leadership South Africa – has been working with security company Fidelity Security and the South African Police Service (SAPS) to provide relief to victims of the devastation caused by the recent heavy rains and flooding in KwaZulu-Natal. Bacsa has done this through its Eyes and Ears (E2) programme, which is an official joint crime-fighting initiative between Bacsa, the SAPS and the private security industry. Under this programme, the private security industry formally cooperates with the SAPS by relaying information directly to provincial operational command centres, while also receiving information from the SAPS. On April 12, 15 teachers and 35 pupils from a school in Hillcrest received some much-needed relief in the form of food, water and blankets, after two days of being trapped on the school premises. All the roads leading to and around the school had been washed away by the flooding and relief could only be supplied using a helicopter. Bacsa MD Tebele Luthuli said that, after receiving an urgent call from E2’s KwaZulu-Natal provincial operational command centre, stakeholders from government, business, civil society and the SAPS came together and formulated a plan to get the food, water and blankets to the school. Through the assistance of Bacsa, Fidelity Security was approached and asked to assist with a helicopter. A flight plan was developed, with coordinates of the pick-up and drop-off sites. Before the meeting with the stakeholders was even concluded, relief to the trapped had already been delivered by Bacsa and Fidelity. The children and educators have since been evacuated from the school by emergency response services. Luthuli said the E2 initiative would continue to provide relief in the affected areas. “We call on members of the public, government, civil society and businesses to lend a helping hand during these unpredictable times.”
