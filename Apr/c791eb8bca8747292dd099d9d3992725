Mobility fuelling station network H2 Mobility Germany has secured €110-million in funding from Hy24, the world’s largest clean hydrogen infrastructure investment platform, as well as its seven existing industrial shareholders to upgrade its hydrogen network and build new stations to meet rising hydrogen demand from commercial and intensive use vehicles. Hy24, through its Clean H2 Infra Fund, provided €70-million of the fresh capital and will become the eighth investor in the Berlin-based company. H2 Mobility Germany’s existing shareholders – Air Liquide, Daimler Truck, Hyundai, Linde, OMV, Shell and TotalEnergies – provided the other €40-million in funding. H2 Mobility already operates more than 90 stations across Germany. It intends to use the new round of funding to further expand its network to 300 stations by 2030. Of these, more than 200 will be large-scale refuelling stations capable of meeting demand for zero-carbon, heavy-duty and long-haul transportation on the European continent. “Heavy mobility is one of the most challenging sectors of the economy to decarbonise, and hydrogen-powered vehicles offer the best solution, as they can refuel quickly and cover long distances without sacrificing payload,” says the company. The expansion of H2 Mobility Germany’s network will be focused on several high-traffic transportation corridors. Many of the company’s new projects will be developed hand-in-hand with public authorities and fleet operators, guaranteeing baseline offtake for the stations. “Green Hydrogen will become a game changer on the journey to replace fossil fuels in transport and to reduce our dependency on extracting resources from our planet’s surface,” says H2 Mobility Germany MD Nikolas Iwan.
