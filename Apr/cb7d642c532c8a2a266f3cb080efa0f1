Industry association the South African Photovoltaic Industry Association (SAPVIA) has welcomed the commitment shown by government with the launch of Bid Window (BW) 6 of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP). Following closely on the announcement of preferred bidders for BW 5, this new BW is critical in the drive to get much-needed additional generation capacity, and ultimately kilowatt-hours, onto the grid, the association emphasises. It posits that, as a trusted partner to government, and in support of its members, the association is ready to support members in ensuring the success of BW6. “This is another positive step forward for the solar photovoltaic (PV) sector and the broader renewable energy market, in our ambition to deliver affordable, secure and clean energy supply to the country. We must do this, as embodied in the economic development requirements of the programme, contributing to South Africa’s development needs. “The continued release of BWs in a timely fashion demonstrates clearly that the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy is intent on harnessing renewable energy capacity to meet the country’s energy requirements and, in doing so, consistently leveraging this significant infrastructure programme to drive economic development,” says SAPVIA spokesperson Maloba Tshehla. He states that solar PV presents the least-cost, quickest-to-build option and says that, with ever-advancing technological capabilities, this sector continues to play an increasingly important role in meeting the country’s capacity requirements, while driving its journey of a just transition. Solar PV will account for 1 000 MW of procured energy in BW 6, with bid submission scheduled for August 11.
