French fuel and energy multinational ST Energies has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a Shell filling station in Worcester, in the Western Cape, to implement a sustainable solar solution that will allow the station to achieve carbon-neutral status. The initiative is designed to deliver reliable power to filling stations using a combination of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, batteries and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) backup to keep them off the grid and operational. ST Energies will install solar PV panels on the canopies of the selected filling station. “The entire setup is designed to ensure the station does not need to pull power from the grid and that it is self-contained enough to run all of its utilities reliably,” ST Energies says. ST Energies has developed the solution to support the South African sector in achieving its carbon-neutral targets, while ensuring that power is sustainable, accessible and reliable. The company says it is committed to building innovative solutions that not only solve ongoing challenges within the country and sector, but that also help meet ongoing environmental, social and governance goals. The solution will be introduced in the Western Cape before being rolled out across South Africa in the near future, the company says.
