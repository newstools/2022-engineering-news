Telecommunications group MTN is working to restore telecommunications services after the heavy rains in KwaZulu-Natal caused widespread infrastructure damage and power outages resulting in over 500 MTN sites down in the region. MTN said in an update on Tuesday that it has activated contingency plans for site restoration and is deploying all possible resources to assist, however, access to many of the impacted sites remains a major challenge. “The flooding in the KwaZulu-Natal region has caused power outages at many of our sites and while we have battery back-up at many of the sites, these batteries have been depleted,” explained MTN South Africa corporate affairs executive Jacqui O’Sullivan. “Our major challenge right now is gaining access to the sites with many roads being damaged or flooded, preventing us from refuelling our batteries or restoring power to the site.” MTN said that the major areas impacted include Durban South, South Coast, Umlazi, Malagazi, Amanzimtoti, Ballito and Salt Rock, besides others.
