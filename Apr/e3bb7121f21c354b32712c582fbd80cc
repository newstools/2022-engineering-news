Industry organisation the Construction Industry Development Board (cidb) has announced that the Empowerment and Recognition of Women in Construction (Erwic) Awards will return for the third time this year. Entries open on May 2, and the cidb encourages women, as well as entities that promote women in the industry, to start preparing their submissions. The Erwic Awards, developed by the cidb, aim to celebrate and encourage the development of women in the construction industry. As with many technical and engineering industries, the built environment sector still has much progress to make before it can be called truly ‘transformed’, the organisation states. It notes that, considering that part of the cidb’s mandate is to promote industry transformation and performance, the organisation created the awards in 2020. “In a male-dominated industry, women are certainly starting to make a notable mark in construction. Thanks to the evolving concerted efforts to encourage women into the sector, today women are increasingly assuming positions once considered ‘male’ roles and overcoming outdated stereotypes,” the cidb notes. It says that, over the past two years, the Erwic Awards have been a driving force for change. One of the aims of the awards is to promote role models for women in lower-grade construction categories and motivate and acknowledge the successes of women in the higher grades. Judges for these awards are leaders within the construction industry and, following an audited adjudication process, the awards ceremony will take place in August, during Women’s Month. The cidb says it believes the awards process will, once again, set a high bar, as women-owned entities showcase the quality projects they have completed within the previous year, as well as their impact on the construction industry.
