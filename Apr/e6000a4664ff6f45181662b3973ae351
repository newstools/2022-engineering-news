The South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Sacci) urges government to do “everything in its power” to assist KwaZulu-Natal businesses impacted by the recent flooding. Sacci also encourages insurance companies to attend to claims expeditiously, while condemning the few who are allegedly “looking for reasons not to pay” instead of doing the “right ethical thing” of assisting businesses and communities with their insurance claims. Sacci requests corporate South Africa and society at large to send donations and any relevant resources and expertise to help the people of KwaZulu-Natal at this difficult time. “Working together we will overcome any difficult situation,” Sacci says in a statement. The chamber also offer its condolences to the families who have lost loved ones as a result of the incident, which currently stands at over 300 fatalities. The loss and damage to infrastructure and commercial logistics platforms as a result of the severe weather event and floods will set KwaZulu-Natal and South Africa’s economic recovery back in a significant way, says Sacci.
