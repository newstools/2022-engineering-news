Telecommunications group MTN’s Supersonic has launched a fifth-generation (5G) offering and expanded its broadband Internet service, Home FLTE. This builds on the launch of the Airfibre solution at the beginning of 2021 and makes further strides in helping connect the unconnected at affordable prices. “Our aim is to consistently provide additional affordable options for more people to access high-quality solutions, with low latency and stable download speeds. We are extremely excited to build on our FLTE and Airfibre innovations to now bring the cutting-edge benefits of 5G to our users,” said Supersonic MD Megan Nicholas. The newly launched month-to-month plans, which include a free-to-use router, comprise the Uncapped Home FLTE offering, with a fair-use policy (FUP) of 400 GB, priced from R499; Uncapped FLTE Premium with a FUP of 1 TB for R699; the Uncapped 5G Lite with a 400 GB FUP, also for R699; and the Uncapped 5G Premium, with a 1 TB FUP, for R999. FLTE is a fixed wireless broadband offering which transfers data using wavelengths and analogue infrastructure, saving costs and expanding reach, without compromising quality. “It continues to grow substantially as a powerful solution for more people to access a world of connectivity,” Nicholas added, noting that the FLTE internet piggybacks on existing infrastructure and is popular as it brings solutions to households which may never have been able to access the benefits of the modern, connected world. “For those wanting even faster speeds, we are adding cutting edge 5G technology to the mix.” “5G technology greatly enhances the number of devices that can be connected to a network without losing quality. It brings the cutting-edge benefits of greater speed and more stability, ensuring users access new opportunities, whether it is working, learning, playing or just staying in touch with family and friends,” Nicholas commented.
