The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) and the Gauteng Department of Roads and Transport (GPDRT) have agreed to end the working relationship that has seen the JRA design, install, repair and maintain traffic signals on behalf of the provincial department. The parties could not reach agreement to renew a service level agreement (SLA) that would have resulted in the agency continuing to actively maintain and repair 231 signalised intersections on provincial roads across the City of Johannesburg. The agreement was terminated with effect from March 31 and a process is under way to hand 231 maintained intersections over to the GPDRT. The handover will continue in terms of the asset registry. Keys to controller boxes and the physical sign-over of the intersection design documents will take place during the week of April 11 to 17. The municipal accounts will then be closed at JRA and the GPDRT will have to open accounts with City Power and Eskom. A JRA technician has been made available to support the GPDRT in terms of site and technical matters from April 1 to 8. “Since April 1, the JRA began attending only to the 1 992 signalised intersections under its jurisdiction, while the provincial department will attend to queries related to its traffic signals.” The roads that will no longer have their traffic signals managed by the JRA include Cedar road, William Nicol drive, Main street, Malibongwe drive, Beyers Naudé drive, Modderfontein road, Christiaan de Wet road, Randfontein road, Chris Hani road and Pretoria Main road, besides others.
