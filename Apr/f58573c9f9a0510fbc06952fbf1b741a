Engineering, management and development consultancy Mott MacDonald has won a project to improve transport infrastructure and support economic growth in Mozambique on behalf of US government agency the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). The $4.3-million five-year project will deliver technical advisory support to MCC’s Transportation and Vertical Structures Practice in Africa. In Mozambique, limited infrastructure and high transport costs have restricted economic growth, Mott MacDonald points out. The consultancy will work with MCC and Mozambique’s government to identify projects in road and logistical infrastructure; support institutional, regulatory and legal reform; and enhance the technical planning processes for transport infrastructure. The company says improved transport links will make it easier for people living in remote communities to travel to urban centres for more employment opportunities and access to essential services such as healthcare and education. The company highlights this as the second major win for Mott MacDonald with the MCC. In 2020, Mott MacDonald won a $3.8-million five-year contract as technical adviser for the Accelerated Growth Corridors project in Malawi. “We are pleased to continue to support MCC and the government of Mozambique in promoting economic growth by improving rural transportation infrastructure and services in Zambezia province. “We look forward to applying our technical, analytical and managerial knowledge and experience to support MCC’s work by promoting political and economic stability, strengthening the country’s resilience to climate change and reducing poverty,” says Mott MacDonald US International Development lead Kevin Hardy.
