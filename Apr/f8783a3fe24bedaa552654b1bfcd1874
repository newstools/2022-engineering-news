From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Simone Liedtke: Beermaker Heineken has built a water reclamation plant at its Sedibeng Brewery, in the Midvaal, investing in technology to reclaim and recycle the water used in its production processes and reduce the amount of water it sources from the municipality. Natasha Odendaal has the story. Natasha Odendaal: The two-million Euro water reclamation plant was commissioned in March 2020 at the eight-million hectolitre a year brewery to help Heineken reduce the amount of water used in its production processes, in line with the groupwide 2030 water strategy, Every Drop, introduced in 2019. Heineken South Africa NPI and masterplan manager Richard Kriel and Waterleau sub-Saharan Africa GM Laurenz Devers tells us more. Richard Kriel: Natasha Odendaal: Heineken is working to reduce the amount of water it takes to produce its beer from roughly 4 litres of water for one litre of beer to 2.5 litres per one litre of beer by 2025. Richard Kriel: Natasha Odendaal: Long-time Heineken partner, Waterleau, started the water reclamation plant project in 2019, with the water, treated 100% to World Health Organisation potable water standards, directed for utility use at the operation.
