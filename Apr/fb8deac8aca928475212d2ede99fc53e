A “Pause Lounge” was launched at the JR005 taxi rank, in Sandton, on April 28, to provide taxi drivers on off-peak times after the morning rush with a place to rest, relax and pass time while they wait for the afternoon or evening peak times. Outfitted with a pool table, foosball and table tennis table, and an arcade machine, the Pause Lounge also provides taxi rank entrepreneurs and traders the opportunity to increase trade as the lounge will be frequented by taxi drivers. The project – implemented by the Eastern Taxi Liaison Committee and supported by a donation of R86 000 from SA Taxi Foundation – is expected to boost funding in the taxi industry as drivers will be expected to pay a fee to enter the lounge and use the equipment there. SA Taxi group communications executive Maroba Maduma says the organisation is always keen to take part in such initiatives that give back to the industry and community. “The sustainability and growth of the industry has proved to be an important vessel in the public transport sector.”
