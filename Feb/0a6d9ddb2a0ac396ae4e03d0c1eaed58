All six bidders have qualified for participation in the auction phase of the ongoing licensing process for International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) spectrum, or high-demand spectrum, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) said. Information and communications technology groups Cell C, Liquid Telecoms, MTN, Rain Networks, Telkom and Vodacom submitted their applications by January 31 in response to the Invitation to Apply (ITA) issued on December 10. “The fact that all six applicants have qualified illustrates the robustness of our telecommunications sector in South Africa. We can officially proclaim the forthcoming March spectrum auction as an unparalleled milestone in our country's communications history as this will be the first ever spectrum auction held on our shores,” said Icasa chairperson Dr Keabetswe Modimoeng. In line with the truncated timetable published by the Authority for this licensing process, and after extensive analysis of received applications, all six applications passed the pre-qualification stage of the licensing process and can now participate in the planned auction stage at the beginning of March 2022. “We commit ourselves to discharge this vital public-interest mandate to the very best of our abilities as we continue to confront the ongoing litigation head-on. With only two weeks remaining, we need to see selfless and responsible corporate citizenship at play,” he commented. The authority will undertake a bidder seminar on February 28, followed by mock-auctions from March 1 to 3 with the individual bidders. After this, the auction stage will start on March 8 with the in-person single round opt-in auction. The main online auction will take place from March 10.
