German vehicle manufacturer Daimler on Tuesday changed its name to the Mercedes-Benz Group, following the split from Daimler Truck. The Mercedes-Benz brand was created in 1926 when the companies of Carl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler merged. “The renaming to Mercedes-Benz Group underlines our renewed strategic focus,” says Mercedes-Benz Group management board chairperson Ola Källenius. “In doing so, we want to make clear where we see the core of our company – building the most desirable cars in the world. We want to continue this legacy of our founders by taking the lead in electric mobility and vehicle software.” The new Mercedes-Benz Group is thus fully concentrating on passenger car brands Mercedes-Benz, Mercedes-AMG, Mercedes-Maybach and Mercedes-EQ, as well as vans. Following the realignment of the original Daimler Group, Mercedes-Benz Group still holds a minority stake of 35% in Daimler Truck Holding. The renaming does not affect South Africa, as the local car company is already known as Mercedes-Benz South Africa.
