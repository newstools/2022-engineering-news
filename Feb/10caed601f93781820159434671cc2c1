The South African motor industry remains buoyant despite the disappointing state of the local economy, says National Automobile Dealers’ Association (NADA) chairperson Mark Dommisse. January new-vehicle sales of 41 382 units showed a 19.5% increase over sales in the corresponding month last year. “Franchised dealers were responsible for 84.2% of these sales, which gave them a flying start to a year that promises to build on the upward trend experienced in 2021,” notes Dommisse. “What is amazing is that these heartening figures were delivered despite shortages of some models due to ongoing component shortages, particularly semiconductors, which are likely to be with us for most of this year. This shortage of product also means that few manufacturers or distributors are offering incentives to buyers, making January’s performance even more impressive. “Rising interest rates and fuel prices will obviously have some impact on the market in 2022, but generally the outlook is brighter than at the same stage last year when [Covid-19] lockdown regulations were more stringent,” says Dommisse. “January was interesting in that we saw better new-car stock availability than in recent months, but with lower stock levels of good used cars,” adds NADA vice-chairperson Alex Boavida. “However, this month should not be seen in isolation, and we need to monitor the new-car versus used-car situation in the months ahead to see the actual trend.” Boavida also notes that some sectors in the luxury segment of the car market improved in January, such as Mercedes-Benz doubling its monthly sales compared with the averages seen in the third and fourth quarters of last year. “Another good example is Porsche which reported 204 units sold – a 114% increase on the figure in December. Sales of other luxury brands seem to be stabilising, but no massive recovery in this portion of the market is expected in the short term.”
