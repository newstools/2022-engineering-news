Global major aerospace group Boeing has announced the launch of a freighter version of its new-generation 777X family of large widebody airliners. The dedicated freighter will be based on the 777-8 model of the 777X family, and so is designated 777-8 Freighter (777-8F), and will be the world’s largest twin-engined cargo aircraft. (The 777X family is based on the proven 777 design but incorporates advanced technologies from the 787 family, as well as an entirely new carbon fibre composite wing and new engines, plus other refinements. The other member of the 777X family is the larger 777-9 airliner.) Further, Qatar Airways has placed firm orders for 34 777-8Fs and has taken out options for another 16, for a total of 50. If exercised in full, this order would have a total value (assuming current list prices) of more than $20-billion. This would make it the biggest ever order, by value, for Boeing freighter aircraft. The 777-8F will also, Boeing stated, be the longest-ranged and most capable twin-engined freighter and have a payload capacity almost the same as that of a 747-400 Freighter aircraft. But the 777-8F will have a 25% increase in fuel efficiency, and thus also a 25% reduction in emissions and operating costs, in comparison with the 747-400F. To be more precise, the 777-8F will have a maximum structural payload of 118 t and a range of 8 167 km. It is expected to enter service during 2027. “Qatar Airways’ selection of the efficient 777-8 Freighter is a testament to our commitment to provide freighters with market-leading capacity, reliability and efficiency,” affirmed Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and CEO Stan Deal. “We are proud that Boeing provides over 90% of the world’s dedicated freighter capacity. With global supply chains under pressure and high demand for e-commerce, the performance and capabilities of the fleet is more important than ever.” “Boeing has a long history of building market-leading freighter aircraft and Qatar Airways is honoured to have the opportunity to be the launch customer for the 777-8 Freighter, an aircraft which will not only allow us to further enhance our product offering for our customers, but also help us meet our objectives to deliver a sustainable future for our business,” highlighted Qatar Airways group CE Akbar Al Baker. “We certainly push Boeing hard to deliver upon our expectations, and the team at Boeing consistently strives to meet and exceed our expectations, giving the opportunity for us to be here today to launch the most significant new freighter aircraft for a generation.”
