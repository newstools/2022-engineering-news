Power management company Schneider Electric, French organisation Agence Française De Developpement (AFD) and the South African Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) have partnered to invest in South Africa’s energy sector. The DHET and Schneider Electric have entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU), while Schneider Electric and AFD have concluded a bilateral agreement. Both agreements are focused on creating training opportunities in the energy sector for South Africa’s youth. The five key objectives include training 10 000 people up to 2027 on energy-related subjects, the training of trainers, capacity building for the practical skill requirements for trade testing, the rollout of digital education programmes through the Schneider Electric Academy in Anglophone Africa, and support for South African entrepreneurs in the energy space. A total of €1.2-million has been allocated to this programme by AFD, Schneider Electric and the Schneider Electric Foundation.
 
This builds on previous initiatives to expand the French South African Schneider Electric Education Centre (F’SASEC) network, established by the French Ministry of Education, the Schneider Electric Foundation, Schneider Electric South Africa and various educational institutions in South Africa. The F’SASEC network focusses on upskilling students with advanced practical training in the field of energy to prepare students for industry requirements. In May 2021, Schneider Electric became one of the first companies in South Africa to join the French Skills Label programme. The French South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry in collaboration with the French Embassy of South Africa launched the French Skills Label, which is issued by the embassy. The French Skills Label highlights what French companies are doing in terms of internal and external training opportunities for South Africans.
