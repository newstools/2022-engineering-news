The Republic of Niger signed an agreement with German energy solution provider Emerging Energy Corporation (EEC) to work together to explore and develop commercial green hydrogen projects in Niger. "Both parties will find opportunities to enable demand for the product and prepare Niger to become a hub for green hydrogen production in the region. "Green hydrogen produced in Niger is an important driver to accelerate industrial decarbonisation and contribute to the electrification of processes, since it is obtained from renewable sources," EEC says.
