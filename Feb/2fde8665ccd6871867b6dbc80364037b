Multinational operations management consulting firm DuPont Sustainable Solutions has announced it will operate under a new name – dss+ – to reflect its expanded capabilities and its commitment to protect, transform and sustain its clients' operations in South Africa, the company says. Following DuPont Sustainable Solutions' separation from DuPont in 2019 to become an independent consulting firm, it has evolved and enhanced its capabilities through organic growth and the acquisition of three organisations to improve the breadth and depth of capabilities in operational excellence, sustainability and environmental, social and governance. “dss+ has a solid history of providing expert process safety management and operational risk management services to many organisations in Africa. Businesses are increasingly aware of the need to integrate transformative solutions to enhance the performance of their operations whilst protecting their people and assets and minimising their impact on the environment,” said dss+ sub-Saharan Africa director Rhyno Jacobs. “The expansion of our offerings to include sustainability alongside our operational excellence and risk management services is a natural progression.” The dss+ purpose and commitment to protecting people remains at the core of the brand. To meet the changing needs of clients, dss+ has expanded its solutions to help companies across a variety of industries to protect, transform and sustain their operations. Through these expanded solutions, dss⁺ will help its clients build organisational and human capabilities, manage risk, improve operations, achieve sustainability goals and operate more responsibly. “It is very energising to see the commitment from leaders we are working with, particularly in the metals and mining industry, toward ensuring they use their resources safely, sustainably and efficiently. Our evolution to dss⁺ is a signal to the market that we are eager to support these changes,” said Jacobs.
