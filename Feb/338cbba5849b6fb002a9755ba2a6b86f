State-owned rail operator Transnet is investigating the cause of a fire that broke out in a coach of the Blue Train early on February 8 while the train was in for repairs at the company’s engineering facility in Koedoespoort. Three people were seen fleeing the scene. One person was apprehended by Transnet security personnel and handed over to the police. Two other people are still at large. The coach in question had been taken to Koedoespoort for repairs after being involved in a derailment last November, the company said. "Transnet has almost completed the investigation into the cause of the November derailment, and as such, today’s incident will not impact the investigations. Any further information will be provided in due course," it said.
