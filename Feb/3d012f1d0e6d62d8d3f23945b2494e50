The South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) will hold a protected general strike, in the Western Cape, on February 23, in support of workers’ rights to a living wage. The Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa (Seifsa) has provided general guidance for its members in this regard. Saftu, on behalf of its 700 000 members, earlier this month called for a basic income grant of R1 500 and announced it would host a National Day of Action, with the National Economic Development and Labour Council having declared the action as protected. Therefore, any employees, including those of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa), as a member of Saftu, partaking in strike action on February 23 will be protected by the normal rules, namely no-work-no-pay and no disciplinary action. Seifsa advises that businesses inform all workers that the no-work-no-pay principle will apply, although no disciplinary action will be taken against strike partakers. A shift for leave pay and leave enhancement pay qualification purposes will be lost in respect of the day’s absence and any overtime worked during the course of the week will be paid at ordinary rates to make up for lost ordinary hours on February 23. The federation adds that, although the strike action seems to be limited to the Western Cape, there may well be stay-away action in other parts of the country, considering that many Saftu member unions, such as Numsa, are nationally active.
