The number of passenger trips recorded on Cape Town’s MyCiTi bus service for the last quarter of 2021 increased by more than 19% compared with the same period in 2020, when South Africa faced harsh lockdowns owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. The City of Cape Town reports that a total of 2.84-million passenger trips were recorded on MyCiTi from October 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020, when South Africa was in the midst of the second wave of Covid-19. This number increased to 3.4-million passenger trips from October 1, 2021, to 31 December last year. “This is an increase of 549 197 passenger trips, or 19.3%, which confirms that more people are commuting as life in Cape Town gradually returns to normal,” says Transport MMC Rob Quintas. “In fact, the nearly 3.4-million passenger trips for the last quarter of 2021 are the most trips we have recorded since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The uptake is wonderful news as we see more people returning to work and school and travelling to popular destinations. It also confirms the popularity of, and demand for, the reliable and affordable MyCiTi bus service.” The MyCiTi service currently consists of 46 routes in the central business district and surrounds, Milnerton, Table View, Dunoon, Joe Slovo, Century City, Blaauwberg, Melkbos, Atlantis, Salt River, Woodstock, Camps Bay and Hout Bay, and includes 39 stations and 500 bus stops. Around 134-million passenger trips have been made on the MyCiTi service since its launch in May, 2010, until December, 2021. “The next big milestone for us is getting the N2 Express buses running,” says Quintas. “The N2 Company and city officials are hard at work to make this happen. We are confident that the service will resume in February and cannot wait to welcome back the commuters from Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha.” The City of Cape Town signed a new operating contract with the N2 Company, equally owned by Lisekhonikamva Rapid Transit Operator from Khayelitsha, Mitchells Plain Integrated Rapid Transit (Route Six from Mitchells Plain), and the Golden Arrow Bus Service on January 20.
