South African private sector airline Airlink has announced that it will restart its scheduled service between Durban and Mbombela (Nelspruit) on April 4. The service will be operated by the company’s Embraer regional jets (Airlink operates both the ERJ135 and ERJ140 models). “Mbombela and Durban are both crucial destinations for South African and international tourists and business travellers,” highlighted airline CEO and MD Rodger Foster. “This new direct service will promote commerce and tourism between the cities and between the Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. For customers, the reintroduction of non-stop flights between the two cities provides greater convenience and options for those who do not need to travel via Johannesburg.” The restarted service will link two of South Africa’s top tourism attractions: the Indian Ocean coast and the Kruger National Park. Three flights will be operated each week, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The flight from Durban will leave at 10:30, while the return flight will depart at 14:30. Each flight will take about 70 minutes. On these flights, economy class passengers will have a free checked-in luggage allowance of 20 kg. They will also have a sporting equipment allowance of 15 kg. All passengers will have a choice of either aisle or window seats; Airlink’s aircraft do not have middle seats. Airlink’s aircraft are fitted with High Efficiency Particulate Air Filters in their cabin air systems. These remove 99.97% of all particulates, including Covid-19 molecules. There are currently no restrictions on domestic travel in South Africa, but the airline advises that international passengers should check South Africa’s current travel requirements before travelling.
