The South African Informal Traders Alliance (Saita) has called for informal traders to be recognised as a critical part of the economy, and deserving of more consultation to develop policies that affect the informal sector. The association, which represents more than two-million informal traders, called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to prioritise an enabling environment and remove barriers that hinder informal traders' ability to trade. Further, Saita called for a halt to harassment of traders, noting that the national enforcement of the Government Gazette waiver of trading permits and licences had been extended by the President until December. The extension was given to all informal traders whose permits had expired, or who began trading and were unable to apply for business trading permits due to lockdown regulations. "Traders are still being harassed by municipalities and law enforcement agencies, as well as having their goods confiscated and being evicted from trade locations, which must stop immediately," Saita says. “Informal traders are the backbone to our economy, employing and sustaining the lives of millions of people.  Last year, Saita launched its one-million jobs campaign, a programme to create one-million jobs by the end of 2023,” Saita president Rosheda Muller says. The informal sector acts as a natural incubator for entrepreneurship, job creation and community development. It is a critical part of the economy that is often overlooked and under-supported, the organisation states. “While Saita has noted the President’s previous recognition of the importance of the sector, we believe urgent and strong action by government is required for informal traders to create and support jobs. We are the engine of the informal economy and we deserve more consultation and recognition when it comes to developing policies that affect our people,” says Muller.
