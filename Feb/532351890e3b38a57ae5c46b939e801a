Mining, industrial, marine and engineering products and applications supplier Cooper&Cooper Group has secured a Level 1 broad-based black economic empowerment (BBBEE) rating. The group says it now boasts 100% black ownership by its female CEO Lorato Mogaki, bringing to the fold her 17-year tenure in senior and executive level positions in the mining industry. Cooper&Cooper Group says it views transformation and the empowerment of women as a business imperative, with the acquisition now forming the core of its business model, while remaining the preferred supplier of customers and the engineering supply chain across the country. Founded in 1897 as a grain merchant, the company later evolved into a motor body shop with the advent of the motor car, being one of Johannesburg’s first panel beaters. The Cooper family later identified the need to start an engineering supplies division, launched with the agency for Carver Clamps, which are still sold by the company. The 1970s saw the business gravitate towards importing and trading in mining, lifting and safety equipment, having acquired the agency for the Nitchi range. The 1980s saw the first branch open in Welkom, thereafter Trichart and Rustenburg. The 2000s saw continued growth in infrastructure and the additional rollout of countrywide branches and a wider vision. Today, Cooper&Cooper Group has sole agencies to distribute international brands in South Africa and the rest of Africa.
