The South African National Road Agency Limited (Sanral) issued a notification to road users on February 23, advising them to expect lane closures on the N1 Northbound between Botha avenue and the N1/R21 Flying Saucer interchange, in Centurion, to allow for rehabilitation work on a sinkhole. The lane closures on the N1 section 21 at kilometre 22.1 will be implemented from February 23 at 22:00 to February 24 at 04:00 and then again from February 24 at 22:00 to February 25 at 04:00. Sanral northern regional manager Progress Hlahla said the closure was required for gravity survey testing to take place in the lanes of the northbound carriageway as part of the geotechnical investigations required for the remediation works on the sinkhole. During the lane closure periods only two lanes will be open. The duration of the closure will be kept as short as possible, Sanral said. “Motorists are requested to plan their trips accordingly, consider alternative routes and use caution when making use of the roads,” Hlahla advised.
