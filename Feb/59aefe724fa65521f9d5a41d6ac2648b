Industry organisation the South African Wind Energy Association (SAWEA) has announced the appointment of Niveshen Govender as CEO. The organisation says he brings a vision founded on predictable and continued procurement with a focus on industrialisation policy and incentives to build more and better local capabilities, for the wind industry to compete with international markets, while supporting local manufacturers to become competitive for export markets. With 12 years in the green economy environment, SAWEA says, Govender has ample experience to tackle this undertaking. It notes that, in this new role, he will be able to capitalise on his diverse knowledge and experience, which ranges from carbon management and climate change to flagship energy project implementation as well as formulating and applying energy policy. “Some of my immediate efforts will be afforded to maintaining key stakeholder relationships, advocating for an enabling policy and regulatory regime, encouraging the transformation and localisation agenda to contribute to the energy transition, building research and information-sharing capabilities, promoting representation by managing the membership and enhancing the organisation's operations,” says Govender. SAWEA operates as a common law, voluntary, not-for-profit association that represents the South African wind industry, led by a board that is primarily concerned with issues of governance and strategy.
