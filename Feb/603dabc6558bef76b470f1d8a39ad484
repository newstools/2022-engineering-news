Six information and communications technology firms have applied for the high demand spectrum set to be auctioned in March. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) received applications from Cell C; MTN; Vodacom; Telkom; Rain Networks and Liquid Telecoms. This marks the next critical milestone in the effort to release the long-awaited and much-needed spectrum. Icasa published the final Invitation To Apply (ITA) for the licensing process for the International Mobile Telecommunications spectrum on December 10, providing for stakeholders to submit their applications by January 31. The announcements of qualifying bidders and start of the actual auction phase are scheduled for February 21 and March 8 respectively. However, the auction process remains at the centre of an upcoming court case, as Telkom works to have Icasa’s ITA spectrum licensing process reviewed and set aside. “We intend to finally see the licensing of high-demand spectrum through to completion to ensure that all South Africans have access to a wide range of communications services, including data services, at affordable prices,” said Icasa chairperson Dr Keabetswe Modimoeng, encouraging the applicants to continue supporting this process until its completion. He further urged all role players to “align their interests with their patriotic spirit”, and to allow this critical regulatory intervention to be completed. “We value each milestone in this process, especially considering the mammoth legal challenges we have encountered along the way. Ultimately, public interest should prevail, as this process will yield positive spinoffs for the industry and society at large,” Modimoeng concluded.
