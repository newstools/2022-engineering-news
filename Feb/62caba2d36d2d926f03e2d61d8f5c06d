Employment and Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi has announced that the national minimum wage (NMW) for each ordinary hour worked has been increased from R21.69 to R23.19, with effect from March 1. As in previous years, the adjustment provides exceptions for several worker groups. While farmworkers and domestic workers are entitled to a minimum wage of R23.19 an hour, workers employed on an Expanded Public Works Programme are entitled to a minimum wage of R12.75 an hour. It is illegal and unfair labour practice for an employer to unilaterally change working hours or other employment conditions to implement the NMW. The NMW is the amount payable for ordinary hours of work and excludes payment of allowances, such as transportation, tools, food or lodging; payments in kind, such as board or lodging; tips; bonuses; and gifts. The legislation requires the NMW Commission to review the rates on a yearly basis and make recommendations to the Minister on any changes to the NMW, while also taking into account alternative viewpoints, including those of the general public. The commission considers a number of factors when determining the yearly adjustment.
