Mahindra, which this year celebrates its eighteenth birthday in South Africa, in January reached “the important 1 000-unit milestone”, when it sold 1 010 units in the first month of the year. This is a 77% improvement over the same month last year. The made-in-South Africa Mahindra Pik Up range remains the Indian manufacturer’s jewel in the crown, with sales of 618 units. “The new sales record is testament to the hard work of our team at Mahindra South Africa and each of our 72 dealers,” says Mahindra South Africa CEO Rajesh Gupta. “The past two years have been tough, and we often faced delays in vehicle shipments from our global plants, as well as other disruptions, such as disturbances in KwaZulu-Natal where our plant is based. “Despite this, our dealer network and team kept morale and momentum high and this has borne fruit.” Gupta says 2022 will be a busy year for Mahindra, with the new XUV700 sports-utility vehicle to make its South African debut.
