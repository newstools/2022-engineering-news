The Western Cape government spent R10.9-million on upgrading the St Christopher pump station, which is responsible for pumping the sewage from three pump stations, including its own, to the Velddrif Wastewater Treatment Works. The pump station has been in service since the 1980s and the upgraded pump station was commissioned in November 2021. The old pump station had only one pump, while the upgraded pump station has two pumps. The new pump station provides higher capacity and reduces the risk of spillages. The project is expected to benefit the Laaiplek community that live near the pump station.
