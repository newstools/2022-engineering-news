The Lufthansa group has introduced a new leisure airline Eurowings Discover to the South African market. The new airline will start direct flights from Frankfurt, Germany, to the Kruger National Park, from November. The Eurowings Discover airline is the first intercontinental airline ever to introduce scheduled air services to the greater Kruger National Park region. In its first season, between November 15 and March 25, 2023, Eurowings Discover will fly three times a week from Frankfurt to Mbombela, with a short stopover in Windhoek. Never before has the destination, which is particularly popular with holidaymakers from Germany, been reached faster and more directly. Eurowings Discover also flies from Frankfurt to Mombasa, Kenya; Zanzibar, Tanzania; Mauritius; and Windhoek, in Namibia. It also plans to start flights to Victoria Falls, in Zambia, and Kilimanjaro, in Tanzania, at a later stage. Eurowings Discover COO Helmut Woelfel says the airline has a strong commercial focus on leisure destinations on the African continent.
