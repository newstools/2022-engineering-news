Oil and gas company TotalEnergies is expanding in Mozambique with the acquisition of oil and gas company BP’s retail network, wholesale fuel business and logistics assets, which are complementary to TotalEnergies’ existing network of 57 service stations and current business-to-business operations. The transaction includes 26 service stations, a portfolio of business customers and 50% in Samcol – the logistics company previously jointly owned by TotalEnergies and BP, which operates the Matola, Beira and Nacala fuel import terminals. With this acquisition, TotalEnergies strengthens its position as the leading retailer of petroleum products in the country, the company says. TotalEnergies chairperson and CEO Patrick Pouyanné inaugurated the new network's first service station to fly the TotalEnergies colours. The solarised service station is in Maputo and has a Bonjour café and store. TotalEnergies now has 19 solarised service stations in Mozambique. "This agreement reflects TotalEnergies' willingness to pursue its investments in Mozambique’s energy sector in order to deploy our multi-energy strategy in the country through retailing of petroleum products for mobility, the major Mozambique liquefied natural gas project and accompanying supply of domestic gas, and opportunities under review in the area of renewable energies. "Our ambition with all this is to contribute to the country's sustainable development and give access to energy to as many people as possible," he says.
