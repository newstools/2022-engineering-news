The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Friday that South Africa's economic outlook was for a recovery in the near term but "lacklustre medium-term performance". In a statement issued at the end of a consultation with South Africa, the IMF said economic growth was projected at 1.9% in 2022 before easing to 1.4% in the medium term. It added that the country's growth outlook was "capped by structural constraints to investment, prevailing policy uncertainty and elevated public debt, which hinders job creation".
