Rand Water has assured that the recent typhoid cases are not linked to tap water. Escherichia coli, a bacteria that is used as an indicator for the presence of faecal pollution and disease causing organisms such as Salmonella typhi, has not been detected in the drinking water supplied by Rand Water. In a statement to the public, Rand Water said that the drinking water supplied by it complies with drinking water standards and is safe for human consumption, as it maintains intensive water quality monitoring programmes and the treatment processes are effective in inactivating harmful bacteria.
