Volkswagen South Africa’s sports-utility vehicle (SUV) range will be bolstered with the market introduction of the Taigo in the first half of this year. The Taigo will join the T-Cross and T-Roc as Volkswagen’s trio of compact SUVs in the local market. By the end of the year, Volkswagen’s T SUV range will consist of seven models, namely the T-Cross, Taigo, T-Roc, Tiguan, Tiguan Allspace, Tiguan R (launching in the local market in the third quarter of the year) and the Touareg. Taigo derives its name from a combination of ‘tiger’ and ‘Taiga’, which is a forest in the northern hemisphere.
