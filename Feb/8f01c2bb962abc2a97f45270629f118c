Cabinet has approved the publication of the draft National Water Resources Strategy third edition (NWRS-3) for public comment. The draft strategy was preceded by a three-year review of the NWRS-2 approved by Cabinet in 2013, which identified areas of success and areas that remain a challenge. The draft strategy proposes strengthened integrated water quality management and introduces a stricter minimum requirement for wastewater treatment. It also provides for innovative and appropriate technology on water and sanitation, while responding to the National Climate Change Response Strategy. “Water remains one of the key drivers in the socioeconomic development of the country and it makes a significant contribution to the economic recovery programme of government,” Cabinet said in a post-meeting statement.
