Steel producer ArcelorMittal South Africa (AMSA) has reported its best financial performance since 2008, with headline earnings surging to R6.86-billion in 2021 from a R2-billion loss in 2020. CEO Kobus Verster attributed the performance to higher sales and production, as well as a strong recovery in prices, with the group’s overall realised steel price in dollars increasing by 62% and by 47% in rand terms. The JSE-listed group’s crude steel production increased by 34%, or 769 000 t, from 2.2-million tonnes in 2020 to 3-million tonnes, and the company’s average capacity utilisation increased from 42% in 2020 to 60% in 2021. Verster reported that capacity utilisation was currently at 79%, following a ramping-up of production and the restoration of stability after the restart of operations in late 2020 and early 2021. “A return to stable, reliable production is key to our commitment to improving our customers’ service experience after a difficult 2020 and early-2021,” Verster said, reporting that the Vanderbijlpark and Newcastle operations completed successful maintenance programmes on their blast furnaces in November and December. The group’s sales volumes increased by 13%, or 284 000 t, to 2.5-million tonnes, underpinned by a 16% rise in domestic sales to 2.2-million tonnes. Exports decreased by 5% to 302 000 t. Imports also played a larger role in meeting demand, with apparent steel consumption in South Africa having increased by 25% to 4.5-million tonnes, driven by the recovery of construction, mining and manufacturing. Imports of primarily hot rolled coil, galvanised sheet and tinplate increased by 47% to 1.4-million tonnes and constituted some 30% of South Africa’s steel consumption for the year, up from 25% in 2020. Ongoing trade protection has been heavily criticised by domestic consumers, particularly during periods of steel shortages in 2020 and 2021. Nevertheless, AMSA said that it would continue to support actions that target unfair trade practices, but noted that the safeguard duties it enjoyed on some products were not extended beyond August 10, 2021. The group says global demand for steel remains positive, but it expects demand in South Africa and the region to ease back to more moderate growth levels in 2022. It would focus on improved production reliability, but warned that volume recovery will be dependent on the reliability of the rail service provided by Transnet. “Aggravated by the high electricity and logistics cost in South Africa, improving ArcelorMittal South Africa’s position on the global cost curve, while bettering its product offering to customers, will be critical to the next phase of its ‘Transforming for Sustainable Growth’ strategy,” the company told shareholders.
