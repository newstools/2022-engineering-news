The N1 South-bound between the Flying Saucer Interchange and Botha avenue on the N1/R21 will be closed from 23:00 on February 6 to 04:00 on February 7 to allow for geotechnical investigations required for the rehabilitation of the N1 sinkhole near the Flying Saucer Interchange in Centurion. Only one lane will be open during this period. "The closure is required for gravity survey testing taking place in the fast lanes of the South-bound carriageway as part of the geotechnical investigations required for the remediation works on the sinkhole," says South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) Northern region manager Progress Hlahla. Sanral became aware of the sinkhole early in January and has since made efforts to prioritise the safety of all road users, including closing off affected lanes immediately, redirecting traffic and alerting the public of the situation. The duration of the closure will be kept as short as possible to avoid any further disruptions, Hlahla says.
