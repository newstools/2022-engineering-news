Rand Water is currently undertaking a programme of renewal and maintenance of its ageing infrastructure to ensure resilient and reliable water supply. The water agency will, during the course of the programme, which comprises the replacement of sections of pipelines that have reached their lifespan, connect new pipelines to the existing network. Some 542 km of Rand Water’s existing 3 650 km network of pipelines cover is planned for replacement over the next five years. Rand Water is augmenting the infrastructure with the installation and integration of 284 km of new pipelines, which will result in water supply interruptions to sections of its area of supply, as the integration requires closing down existing sections of the pipelines. In February, Rand Water will be completing and commissioning a total of 10 km of five pipelines. From February 18 to 20, the group successfully completed work on the S1 pipeline to integrate the new Vlakfontein reservoir, G17 pipeline, L6 pipeline and E14 pipeline. “We wish to thank communities in City of Ekurhuleni and City of Tshwane for their patience and support over this past weekend’s shutdown.” “We have developed a detailed shutdown programme for the rest of the year which will be communicated to various stakeholders,” Rand Water said in a statement.
