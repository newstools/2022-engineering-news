Chinese vehicle importer JAC Motors South Africa (SA) says “impressive sales growth” in 2021 at its 62 dealerships in South Africa, eSwatini and Nambia has necessitated the opening of a new, larger parts warehouse. The new warehouse is 25% bigger than the previous facility, says the company. It is also better stocked than the last warehouse because of a shelving system that more than doubles the available storage space. "Remarkable car parc growth and the fact that the brand is here to stay as a permanent fixture on the local automotive scene, made the investment decision in our new state-of-the-art parts warehouse easy,” says JAC Motors South Africa CEO Karl-Heinz Göbel. Aside from being larger than the previous warehouse, the new facility has been equipped with an ordering system that allows the dispatching of orders in the quickest possible time, he adds. The new system also tracks parts in real-time. The company’s new parts warehouse is located in Roodepoort. The company does not quantify its sales growth for 2021, and neither does it specify the investment value of the new warehouse.
