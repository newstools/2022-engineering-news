The Solidarity trade union has announced that it will pursue criminal charges against those responsible for theft and mismanagement at the country’s State-owned entities (SOEs). It did so in a statement reporting its latest legal success, on behalf of its members, against the Denel defence industrial SOE. Regarding Denel, the Johannesburg Labour Court has ordered the SOE to pay R90-million to those of its employees who are members of Solidarity. This money is to cover overdue salaries and other payments due to these employees. Some Denel workers have not received their full salaries since May 2020. The court gave the company ten days to implement this order. “We are incredibly grateful for the relief this order brings to our members,” affirmed Solidarity CE Dr Dirk Hermann. “Our members had to do their work almost continually without full pay and this amid the major uncertainty and challenges the Covid-19 pandemic brought. Although we are, of course, delighted with the outcome it is still a crying shame that we have to approach the courts on an ongoing basis to force State entities to fulfil their duties towards employees.” On a previous occasion, when Denel had failed to comply with a court order to pay its employees, Solidarity had sought and received warrants to seize Denel property worth R12-million. The SOE had then paid what it owed. Hermann stated that if Denel did not comply with this latest court order, the union would instruct the sheriff to seize assets belonging to the SOE. But further action was needed. “We cannot allow that our members and ordinary taxpayers have to carry the can for the State’s mismanagement anymore while the plunderers can simply carry on plundering with impunity,” he asserted. “We have to take matters further. We will now carry on with litigation and will file criminal charges to ensure that those who caused this mess can be held accountable for it.”
