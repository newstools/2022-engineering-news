Telecommunications giant MTN expects to report an increase in headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the year ended December 31, 2021. However, the company anticipates a decrease in earnings per share (EPS) when it publishes its financial results for the year on March 9. HEPS will increase by between 25% and 35%, or 187c to 262c, to a range of 936c to 1 011c for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with the 749c reported in the prior year. HEPS for the year under review were negatively impacted by a number of non-operational and one-off items with a net total of about 123c in 2021, down from 128c in the preceding year. These include items largely relating to hyperinflation excluding impairments at -42c; foreign exchange losses at 111c; other non-operational items at 30c and notable donations related to Covid-19 support for the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the Coalition Against Covid task force in Nigeria at 24c. EPS, meanwhile, are expected to decrease by between 15% and 25%, or 142c to 237c, to between 710c and 804c for the year to December 2021, from 946c in the year before. The EPS include impairment losses of 64c relating mainly to MTN Yemen, largely noncash losses from the deconsolidation of subsidiary MTN Syria of about 262c and fair value gains on acquisition or disposal totalling 99c from the disposal of ATC Uganda and ATC Ghana tower joint ventures.
