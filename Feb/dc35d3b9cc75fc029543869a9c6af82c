The Department of Public Works and Infrastructure (DPWI) says the South African Police Service has taken swift action in arresting an armed group of six individuals that invaded the Durban High Court construction site on February 1. The group of invaders allegedly forced access onto the site and stopped workers and contractors from doing their jobs, in an attempt to gain control of the construction site. The DPWI believes the group originated from a local development forum. “It is such disruptions that have led to delays in many projects, disrupting service delivery and holding the country to ransom,” said DPWI acting director-general Imtiaz Fazel in a statement. Construction at the site will resume on February 7. The High Court redevelopment project started on May 6 last year and is expected to be completed in September 2025, at a cost of R850-million. The project involves renovating the existing building, as well as the construction of two new buildings to accommodate additional courtrooms and staff.
