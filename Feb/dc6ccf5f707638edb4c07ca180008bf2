Industry organisation the South African Photovoltaic Industry Association (SAPVIA) has appointed Pierre Nothard as interim COO. This follows Niveshen Govender's decision to accept a position outside the association. “Niveshen leaves SAPVIA after five years, having joined as a programme manager in 2016 before taking on the responsibilities of COO in 2019. Niveshen leaves SAPVIA with the thanks and very best wishes of the board and our members. His efforts to professionalise the association, drive value for our members and advocate on behalf of solar PV and renewables are to be commended,” says SAPVIA chairperson Wido Schnabel. Govender’s dedication to not only the growth of the association, in its mission to be a trusted partner in the advancement of solar PV in South Africa, but to also strengthen the value-add experienced by members, are the hallmark of his tenure, he says. “The numerous networks, relationships and spaces that he created for SAPVIA to realise its mandate will continue to stand the Association and its members in good standing for the next decade of our work. While we are sad to see him go, I have no doubt that he will continue to collaborate and work together with SAPVIA to drive the renewables agenda forward,” says Schnabel. Nothard spent 26 years in various general management positions within the Allied Electronics (Altron) Group, and one year as Xerox India MD in 2002. From 2012 to 2019, he incorporated and served as electrical-industry body South African Safehouse Association chairperson.
