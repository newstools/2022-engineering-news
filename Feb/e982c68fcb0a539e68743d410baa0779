FAW Trucks South Africa’s (SA’s) 8 000th local unit has rolled out of the assembly line at its Coega manufacturing plant, almost eight years after production trials started in May 2014. The first unit off the line in 2014 was a 15.180FL, but the 2022 honour fell to the newly introduced JH6 28.500FT, the flagship in the current local line-up. “The assembly of our 8 000th unit is an understandably proud moment for us, especially as it comes on the back of the introduction of yet another new model derivative,” says FAW Trucks SA CEO Yongjun Li. “Since first entering the South African market 28 years ago, we have gone from strength to strength, providing local buyers with products of high quality that are not only well suited to local conditions, but also boast high levels of safety, convenience and comfort. We have managed to combine this with competitive pricing, low running costs and continuously improving aftersales service.” Funded by the China FAW Group Corporation and the China-Africa Development Fund, the Coega facility was built at a cost of R600-million and spans some 30 000m². The plant employs 148 people. “With a production capacity of 3 000 units per annum, scalable to 5 000 as demand grows, we produced 1 539 units at the plant in 2021 [at an average of 128 units a month],” says plant manager Peng Lei. “This will be ramped up to an average of around 200 units a month in 2022, covering six to seven different models. “If all goes according to plan, we are confident that we will assemble the 10 000th unit in December this year.” All units arrive in South Africa in completely knocked-down form and are then assembled at the Coega plant. “The reason for our continued growth in South Africa is the fact that we cater to virtually every need,” explains Li. “Our line-up includes freight carriers, truck tractors, tippers and mixers, all assembled to exacting standards to be able to withstand the harsh conditions of the African continent.”
