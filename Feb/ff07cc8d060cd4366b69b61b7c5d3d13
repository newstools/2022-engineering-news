Renewed turmoil in the trucking industry has prompted the Road Freight Association (RFA) to again call for urgent intervention by the South Africa Police Service (SAPS). The All Truck Drivers Forum (ATDF) has called on truck drivers not to operate on Monday. ATDF action has been reported in parts of the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and the Northern Cape. The forum focuses on a number of issues, including the employment of non-South African truck drivers by some fleet operators. Past activities by disgruntled truck drivers have included the closure of highways and the burning of trucks. “Once again, the road freight and logistics industry is being held ransom and attacked by parties who are unhappy with conditions or matters within the sector,” notes RFA CEO Gavin Kelly.

“The RFA has repeatedly called on the SAPS to protect the lives and health of our drivers, to protect the vehicles and cargo of our members and to ensure that, whilst there is the right to highlight and discuss issues, that the blatant disregard of anyone else's right to safety, security, employment and the opportunity to operate a business for the betterment of all cannot be tolerated.” Employers not registered with the National Bargaining Council for the Road Freight and Logistics Industry must be dealt with, notes Kelly. “Those officials who are open to bribery and corruption, who refuse to perform their duties in terms of the mandates given to the various departments, must be censured or disciplined. “We cannot continue to absorb these attacks,” adds Kelly. “The compliant operators are being continually attacked and pushed out of the sector. South Africa is losing any sense of safety and efficiency in terms of moving goods through the country to the ports. We are beginning to feel the backlash from neighbouring countries. We must fix this now!”
