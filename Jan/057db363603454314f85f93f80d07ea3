Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) has extended the closing date for the Census 2022 household registration to February 5, to allow more respondents to select their preferred mode to be counted. Respondents are required to register on https://getcounted.statssa.gov.za to have the option of completing the census questionnaire remotely. The remote data collection involves respondents choosing self-enumeration, where they complete the questionnaire from their homes, online (which will use no data). An online questionnaire will be sent to registered respondents to fill out. Another option is for respondents to be interviewed over the telephone. They also need to register either online, with a Stats SA fieldworker or a call centre clerk for a Stats SA official to contact them and assist with filling in the census questionnaire. Lastly, respondents could choose to have a fieldworker visit their household to conduct a face-to-face interview to complete the census questionnaire with the respondent. Fieldworkers will visit households that do not register and those that register but do not complete the questionnaire online or by telephone within the designated time period, Stats SA explains.
