The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) is monitoring a potential supply shortage of liquid gas chlorine, which could impact the treatment of potable water and effluent water managed by water service authorities (WSAs), metropolitans and water boards. “The DWS is aware of the incident related to possible liquid gas chlorine supply shortages from the supplier based in Kempton Park, Gauteng,” the department said in a statement on January 20. “While DWS has no intention of speaking on behalf of the chlorine gas supplier, it believes the supplier will do everything in its power to ensure that water supply and effluent water treatment are not negatively impacted by the shortages,” assured DWS national spokesperson Sputnik Ratau. The latest report from the supply company indicates that production is stable at 80%. As at January 19, the supply company was packaging chlorine for the City of Cape Town in accordance with the existing agreement. “As the department, we hope that water boards, metropolitans and WSAs have spare supplies that will last them until shortages subside,” says Ratau. However, no reports have been received that water boards are experiencing shortages of chlorine in their operations. “DWS, through its provincial offices, will continue to track daily reports across the country to determine how the shortages are affecting the WSAs, metropolitans and water boards if at all.” The department will monitor the developments and work with all affected parties to ensure the quality of the water supplied to water users and the receiving environment are not compromised.
