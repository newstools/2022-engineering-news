JSE-listed investment manager Invicta Holdings has entered into an agreement with International Holdings and Investments and KMP Holdings MD Chen Chin Linn to acquire all the share capital of KMP for £12.5-million, or nearly R270-million. KMP is an independent supplier of aftermarket heavy-duty diesel engine parts for industrial and agricultural machinery. Its main distribution facilities are located in Chertsey, in the UK, and Houston and Miami, in the US. KMP sells to more than 150 countries worldwide, including parts suitable for Komatsu, Caterpillar, Cummins and John Deere engines. Invicta has set out to diversify into new geographical areas in the industries and markets in which it has significant experience and KMP fits this profile. The Invicta subsidiary that will be taking over KMP is Equipment Spare Parts Africa, which has been a major KMP customer. The acquisition will provide cross training and skilling opportunities, and potential economies of scale, Invicta states.
