KwaZulu-Natal has a masterplan in place to drive developments around the Mkhuze Airport, which is undergoing a R72-million upgrade. During a visit to the airport this week, Premier Sihle Zikalala said that the masterplan was expected to attract critical infrastructure investment in mixed-use developments on land adjacent to the airport, while also supporting a proposed agri-hub in Mkhuze. “We have a Regional Airport Strategy that identifies nine strategic regional airports in KwaZulu-Natal as critical for tourism and cargo development in the province. We pronounced on the upgrade of Mkhuze Airport during the State of the Province Address. "The progress we are observing is further evidence of the provincial government’s programme of action to position the province as a leading provider of aviation and transport infrastructure in Africa and the world,” the Premier commented. He added that Mkhuze Airport would complement King Shaka International Airport through chartered flights from Durban and other major areas such as Cape Town, Johannesburg and the Kruger National Park. “The upgrading of Mkhuze Airport augurs well with the provincial government’s quest of increasing tourism connectivity in the province, particularly to the uMkhanyakude district, [which has] the highest concentration of game reserves,” he said. Zikalala also welcomed the return of Qatar Airways to Durban following its withdrawal ahead of the festive season over Covid-19-related health and safety concerns. “Direct links to mid-hemisphere hubs such as Doha, in the Gulf region, bring the world closer by providing easy access to the global capitals of the world."
