Global logistics brand DHL Global Forwarding has launched in Zimbabwe to extend its presence across Africa. The international air, ocean and road freight services provider will give local and regional businesses within the greater Southern African Development Community (SADC) region instant access to global markets, the company said in a statement. As a first step, DHL Global Forwarding has set up a legal entity currently employing eight graduate trainees, with an office in Harare’s central business district. The new entity comprises a full suite of technology solutions and market knowledge aimed at addressing the challenges faced by the country’s freight forwarding and logistics industry. Its primary purpose is to infuse the sector with international standards synonymous with DHL and show the market the possibilities of conducting business in a compliant manner, DHL said. The offering also includes DHL subsidiary Saloodo!’s digital road freight platform connecting shippers and transport providers. The platform maps all transport processes digitally, including shipment tracking, freight document management, invoicing and payment. DHL Global Forwarding provides the mass network to move heavy machinery by road – mostly imported from China, Germany and India – for Zimbabwe’s mining and manufacturing sectors. The logistics provider’s air freight services will support the export of perishable goods, currently Zimbabwe’s most significant export commodity, as well as tobacco and hemp. Moreover, the expansion of DHL’s services in Zimbabwe will also accommodate the global export of agricultural products; and gold – the country’s top mineral export.
