The Competition Tribunal has unconditionally approved a merger between infrastructure development and construction materials supply company Raubex and mining and exploration company Bauba Resources. Post-merger, Raubex will attain sole control over Bauba. This follows Raubex Group, through its subsidiary Raubex, in November 2021 expressing intent to acquire all the issued share capital in Bauba. Bauba has a primary focus on mining chrome ore and exploring for platinum group metals.
