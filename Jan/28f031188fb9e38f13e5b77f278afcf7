The City of Johannesburg (CoJ) has urged architectural professionals to register building plans online going forward, given that the Department of Planning has migrated its Construction Permit Management System (CPMS) to a digital platform. This means doing away with paper-based manual submissions for building plan applications. Development Planning MMC Belinda Echeozonjoku says the system is designed to optimise the construction permitting process and seeks to enhance the operational efficiency and good governance of the Department of Planning, as well as align with Joburg’s Smart City programme. As the system is still in a trial phase, the department is working on resolving outstanding technical and security issues. “As with every new system, we are experiencing a few challenges that are currently being addressed,” explains Echeozonjoku, in apologising for the inconvenience. Moreover, the CPMS aims to promote the use of skilled technical professionals – qualified architectural professionals registered with the South African Council for the Architectural Profession. The system automatically rejects the applications of unaccredited individuals.
