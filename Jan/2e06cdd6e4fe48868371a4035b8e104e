Durban-based shipbuilding and repair company, Sandock Austral Shipyards (SAS), has added a range of tug boats to its product offering, following the signing of an agreement with Canadian naval architect firm Robert Allan. The agreement will allow SAS immediate access to a host of designs. SAS marketing and sales head Charles Maher says SAS selected Robert Allan as a partner owing to its strong global presence, with more than 1 000 Robert Allan-designed tugs operating in the world. “Robert Allan has a significant range of vessels available that it has developed and built in conjunction with other shipyards across the world. “Initially, we will be concentrating on their range of Azimuth Drive Tugs, which we will bring to a much wider audience.” “SAS operates on a global scale,” adds Maher. “This significant partnership with such a prestigious naval architect design house to provide clients with state-of-the-art designs, with quick turnaround times and already-in-production designs, releases a lot of risk from our company and we can enter a tender with a much higher response rate.” “We are looking forward to our designs becoming more prevalent in the African market, backed by the proximity, familiarity and quality that SAS offers to its African clients,” notes Robert Allan project development director Jim Hyslop. SAS is a design, manufacturing, and commissioning company in the maritime, defence and energy sectors. The company is primarily based in Durban, but also has operations in Cape Town, East London, Richards Bay and Johannesburg. The company has been in operation for more than 60 years and still hold the record for building the largest marine vessel in Africa.
