Passenger rail service operator Metrorail has closed one line between the Soshanguve and Mabopane stations following a technical fault and train incident. A train en route to Mabopane station experienced a technical fault outside Soshanguve station on January 24 at about 05:30. Metrorail says the technical team, upon attending to the fault by uncoupling the set, experienced a roll back of the set onto the other – causing a collision. The train set had eight staff members, but no commuters, on board at the time of the incident. The first Metrorail train from Mabopane to Pretoria was delayed by 30 minutes and all other trains are operating on schedule. The estimated cost of the damaged new rolling stock is not yet known and accessors are at the scene to make the determination, Metrorail says. It notes that there are no damages to the infrastructure. An investigation of the incident is under way. Metrorail train services are not affected and no further delays are expected.
