Rail operator Transnet Freight Rail’s (TFR’s) security have arrested three suspects who were found with uninterrupted power supply (UPS) batteries that are used by the rail operator during power failures. TFR says that, on January 27, at about 20:00, while the TFR security was doing patrol at the Saaiwater Depot, near Ogies, in Mpumalanga, they came across a suspect private vehicle in the area and approached it for a stop and search. As TFR security was searching the vehicle, the three suspects at the back of the van fled and the three in front were arrested. One of the arrested suspects was confirmed as a Transnet employee who had just finished his shift at 16:00. As noted, the three apprehended suspects were found with UPS batteries. The three suspects appeared in court on January 28, and their case has been postponed for further investigations. TFR has appealed to communities to come forward with information that may assist in putting a stop to such criminality and has urged all stakeholders, including scrap metal dealers, foundries and smelters, to refrain from buying overhead cables from unregistered traders.
