Business Unity South Africa (Busa) has welcomed the publication of Part 1 of the Zondo Commission report into State capture, but says it must be studied carefully and urgently. “We will, as a country, only address the scourge of corruption and State capture, including dealing with it systemically and breaking the solid structures aiding and abetting this, if we act on the recommendations urgently and take quick action against identified perpetrators through the legal system. “This applies across society, in government, business, labour and other parts of civil society. The success of the work of the commission will best be measured by whether we can take action to reset our society’s moral compass,” says Busa CEO Cas Coovadia.
