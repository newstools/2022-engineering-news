Messe Frankfurt South Africa has decided postpone Automechanika Johannesburg & Futuroad from March this year to June. “After having engaged with our exhibitors and partners in the automotive aftermarket industry, the unanimous feedback has been that the timeline to June will allow for sufficient time for international and domestic companies to prepare for their trade show participation,” says the company.

Automechanika Johannesburg & Futuroad is set to bring together manufacturers, distributors, retailers and various service providers that are active in the automotive aftermarket value chain.
 
“The market has undergone tremendous changes in the last 18 months and this will be the very first time for the entire industry to be back face to face,” says Messe Frankfurt South Africa MD Michael Dehn.
