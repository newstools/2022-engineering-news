Multinational law firm Pinsent Masons has hired partner Edward James to bolster its corporate crime and investigations capabilities in South Africa. Joining from South Africa-headquartered firm ENSafrica, James will work predominantly with the firm’s global energy and infrastructure sectors and is expected to enhance the firm’s forensics, criminal investigations and compliance capabilities in Africa. He is a corporate crime and investigations specialist advising clients on compliance, fraud, bribery and corruption, corporate espionage, anti-money laundering, cyber-breaches and economic sanctions. “Many of the megatrends that influence global economies – such as lowering carbon emissions – are amplified in Africa due to soaring increases in population and a network of infrastructure that is not fit for purpose. “The investment required is substantial, but so too are the opportunities. The private sector will play a major role in driving development, but investment must be cautiously managed in geopolitically volatile regions. “Edward brings significant compliance and corporate crime expertise, domestic market understanding and the right long-term thinking to help clients cultivate these opportunities and reap the rewards,” says Pinsent Masons Johannesburg head Junaid Banoobhai.
