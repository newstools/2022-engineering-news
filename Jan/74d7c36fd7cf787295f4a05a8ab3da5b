The City of Cape Town is offering a R5 000 reward for information that leads to the positive identification and arrest of those responsible for the stoning of a brand new train. A group of youth pelted the Metrorail train between Steenberg and Fish Hoek last week, damaging the train driver's window. Repairing the damages would cost the City an estimated R20 000. "Damages to critical infrastructure are completely unacceptable, even if it is perpetrated by youth who think that stoning trains is 'fun'," said mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis. Hill-Lewis said that for too long, a well-functioning rail service had been absent from the city and millions of Capetonians suffered as a result. "Capetonians end up having to spend more of their income on other forms of public transport and take longer to get to work and back home. We cannot allow a few individuals who wish to damage and steal public infrastructure to rob us of all of the resources we need to improve our lives," said Hill-Lewis. According to the City, Metrorail confirmed that a window on the brand new southern line train was broken due to stone throwing on its first day of operation last week. Anyone with information on the incident can contact the Public Emergency Call Centre (107 from a landline and 021 480 7700 from a cellphone.)
