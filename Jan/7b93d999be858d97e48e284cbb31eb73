Professional services firm PwC’s December 2021 Global Consumer Insights Pulse Survey finds that, while consumers are increasingly considering sustainability as a key factor in making buying decisions, price and convenience remain key. More than half of the 9 370 individuals surveyed reported that they were more eco-friendly than six months ago. However, of these respondents, 68% of in-store shoppers reported that they continue to actively seek the best deal compared with 42% who actively search for eco-friendly and sustainable products. According to pork manufacturer Eskort, these trends and findings bode well for the South African pork industry moving into this year. “Notably, however, compared to other forms of protein, pork remains a top competitor in all three categories, offering the benefits of affordability, accessibility and sustainability, in addition to its great taste and versatility. “As households globally come to appreciate its relative advantages, this could finally place pork at the top of shopping lists where it belongs in a win-win for consumer health and wallets, as well as the environment,” posits Eskort CEO Arnold Prinsloo. He adds that pork is available, on average, at two-thirds of the price of beef and less than half the price of lamb or mutton. Moreover, he says pork prices have decreased over the past 12 months. Prinsloo also says studies have shown that the environmental impact of producing pork is comparable with poultry and eggs.
