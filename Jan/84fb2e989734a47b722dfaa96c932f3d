JSE-listed Fortress REIT has acquired its third logistics asset, MDC2 Park Łódź South, located south of Łódź in central Poland. Driven by the demand to supply high-growth western European economies, the first two signature acquisitions in Poland were made in 2020 to deepen and extend the investment proposition of Fortress in prime locations, the company notes. This distribution centre will be located south of Łódź, at the junction of the A1 motorway and the National Roads No 91 and 12. The development is slated for completion in the third quarter of 2023. The development will offer a leasable area of up to 80 000 m2 of modern, environmentally-sustainable logistics space. MDC2 Park Łódź South is designed with environmental and sustainable governance at its core. For example, 95% of the construction materials that will be used are recyclable and the roofs of the buildings are designed to be photovoltaic-ready. “We are extremely happy to have acquired this asset, as it perfectly fits our strategic investment profile. “MDC2 Park Łódź South will provide the highest standard for a modern big-box logistics facility and will include solutions addressing environmentally responsible, as well as sustainable, building features sought by the tenants,” says Fortress MD Maciej Tuszyński.
