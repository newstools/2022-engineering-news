Water and Sanitation Minister Senzo Mchunu plans to establish a political steering committee on water in Limpopo to oversee various water and sanitation projects in the province. The committee is to be led by Premier Stan Chupu Mathabatha. “Due to the lack of an MEC [for] water in the province, the establishment of the political steering committee is of the utmost importance. The committee will ensure that water challenges are resolved from the top, in order to support municipalities in properly executing water services to the people,” Mchunu said during a meeting with the Lebalelo Water Users Association on Thursday. The Minister met with the association to hear about the progress made on the proposal it came up with together with the Department of Water and Sanitation to improve the supply of water to relevant communities from the De Hoop dam.
