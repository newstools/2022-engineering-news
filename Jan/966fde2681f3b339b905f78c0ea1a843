Metrorail Western Cape will resume services between the Fish Hoek and Simon’s Town stations on January 5. This means all 29 stations between the Retreat station and the Simon’s Town station will be fully operational, the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) said on January 4. Metrorail will operate both the yellow and grey trains at peak and its new trains during off-peak service as per the Rail Safety Regulator directives, PRASA noted. "Metrorail will operate under strict speed restriction as additional repairs will continue, including the management of sand blowing onto the tracks and damaging critical equipment on the ground. This means customers must plan their departure along adjusted delays until the rail repairs and maintenance are completed. "In addition, Metrorail will be implementing additional repair works in the area which may require temporary closures to fix sand issues, which are endemic to the area." Metrorail undertook a series of repair works, which include fallen mast poles at Glencairn as a result of weather conditions and natural corrosion. Additional platform repair works were also undertaken at Glencairn station. Meanwhile, PRASA is implementing Phase 1 of the Central Line recovery to introduce the Langa to Cape Town Service via Pinelands. This is to allow for the relocation of communities settled on Metrorail rail tracks. Seven critical projects are either under way or in the planning stages. These are a walling project, a re-signalling project, station rehabilitation, substation rehabilitation, rehabilitation of overhead track equipment, perway rehabilitation and relocation of informal settlements on the PRASA rail line.
