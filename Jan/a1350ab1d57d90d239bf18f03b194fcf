The public technology commercialisation agency the Technology Innovation Agency (TIA) has had a new board of directors appointed by Higher Education, Science and Innovation Minister Dr Blade Nzimande at a time when the agency is increasingly being called upon to find ways to maximise its impact as it executes its mandate of technology innovation and commercialisation, says TIA acting CEO Patrick Krappie. The new board includes chairperson Matsi Modise, Dr Revel Iyer, Anati Canca and Lindiwe Matlali, while Butana Mboniswa, Thabiso Ramasike and Sebenzile Matsebula are returning to the board, as will Krappie. The board plays a pivotal oversight role, helping to guide the strategic direction of TIA. This board brings with it a wealth of experience and expertise from various areas in the innovation ecosystem. These include venture capital, techno-entrepreneurship, intellectual property management, technology transfer and governance, the TIA says in a statement. “I would like to thank the outgoing board for their vision, commitment and dedication in ensuring that TIA delivers on its mandate. The new board comes at an exciting, yet challenging time for the National System of Innovation, where the agency is increasingly being called upon to find ways to maximise impact as it executes its mandate of technology innovation and commercialisation,” says Krappie. “I look forward to working with the board to ensure the TIA continues to deliver on its mandate in response to key government policy priorities.”
