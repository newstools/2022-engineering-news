Agricultural firm Grosso Foods has undergone a rebrand to Grosso Africa to coincide with its strategic expansion plans. The Tanzania-based company distributes conservation agriculture equipment and smart farming solutions. Grosso Africa CEO Nuradin Osman says the new name represents where the company is going, shows continued commitment to the customers that helped the company get there and points to the future. Specifically, he says, Grosso Africa’s new distribution agreement of brands LS Tractor and Jan Agricultural Equipment reflects the company’s commitment to meeting farmers’ needs with high-horsepower tractors, precision planning and seed drill and self-propelled sprayers, among other smart farming solutions. Grosso Foods started out with a focus on last mile farmer-level transformation – increasing yields, reducing post-harvest losses, improving market access and elevating product margins based on investment, advocacy and project management. The business also supplied farmers with carefully selected offerings of agricultural equipment and skilled personnel. Today, Grosso Africa rents and sells farming equipment, as well as offers agricultural contracting and leasing to farmers. The company supports its farmers through highly skilled farm machinery operators and agricultural experts with decades of experience in the agriculture machinery industry and precision agriculture technology. Grosso Africa will continue to advance conservation agriculture practices by focusing on minimal to no-till methods of farming.
