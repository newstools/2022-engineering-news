The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (Sahpra) has issued a licence to GESlabs to manufacture cannabinoid pharmaceutical ingredients for use in therapeutic medicines. The company built a R20-million pharmaceutical laboratory in Cape Town, which will serve local, regional and international markets. It will start production immediately and ship its first sample of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to the US, the UK, Germany and Australia in February. Using carefully cultivated biomass, processed through world-class technology, GESlabs can deliver APIs for use in prescription medicines and wellness supplements. Sahpra was involved with the design of the facility from the outset and collaboratively shaped the space to ensure the final outcome met the exacting quality and safety standards set by the organisation and the global certification. GESlabs MD Peter Nel praises Sahpra for being a helpful partner over the last 18 months, with the organisation finding time to assist with the facility despite the sudden and intense pressures it faced as the central agency for Covid-19 vaccinations. He adds that effective regulation of cannabinoids is vital for the long-term safety and reputation of the pharmaceutical sector. The organisations will remain partners and ensure standards continue to be adhered to as legislation is amended. The organisations agree that ensuring continued efficacy of manufactured medication is crucial for the protection of the local and international reputation of the South African pharmaceutical industry.
