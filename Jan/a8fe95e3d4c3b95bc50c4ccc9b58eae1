The 52 MW Malindi solar photovoltaic (PV) plant, in Langobaya, Kenya, has been exporting 40 MW of power into the national grid since December 14. The $69-million solar plant, developed by independent power producer (IPP) Globeleq and its project partner Africa Energy Development Corporation (AEDC), is made up of 157 000 PV panels and is one of the first IPP-owned utility-scale solar plants in Kenya, as well as the only renewable power plant located in the coastal area. Electricity is being sold through a 20-year agreement with the national distribution company, Kenya Power. The project also included the construction of the new 220 kV Weru substation which has already been handed over to Kenya Power and is now a part of the national grid infrastructure. The plant will avoid 44 500 t/y of carbon dioxide emissions. “It is exciting to see this plant operating. Malindi is our tenth operational solar PV plant in Africa and cements our position as a leader in large-scale solar generation. Thank you to all involved for making this project a success and supporting plans to achieve net zero by 2050,” Globeleq CEO Mike Scholey says. “AEDC is pleased that the Malindi project has reached this all-important milestone and is contributing to Kenya’s supply of renewable and affordable electricity,” adds AEDC director Zohrab Mawani. The plant is located in Langobaya, in the Malindi district of Kilifi county, about 120 km north-east of Mombasa. Construction started in 2019. Financing of Malindi Solar was organised by UK development finance institution CDC as the lead arranger and the project sourced $52-million in debt financing, including $20-million from German development finance institution DEG, Globeleq says.
