Europe-based global major aerospace group Airbus announced on Monday that it had achieved its 2021 target for deliveries of commercial aircraft. During the year, the company delivered 611 commercial aircraft to 88 customers. Commercial aircraft deliveries in 2020 had totalled 566. Of the aircraft delivered last year, 5% went to operators in Africa and the Middle East, 30% to airlines in the Asia Pacific, 17% to European carriers, 2% to operators in Latin America and 16% to airlines in North America, while lessors accounted for 29% and “other” for 1%. Some 25% of these deliveries were conducted using Airbus’ established ‘e-delivery’ procedures, which allowed clients to take delivery of their aircraft while minimising the need for their personnel to travel. “Our commercial aircraft achievements in 2021 reflect the focus and resilience of our Airbus teams, customers, suppliers and stakeholders across the globe who pulled together to deliver remarkable results,” highlighted Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury. “The year saw significant orders from airlines worldwide, signalling confidence in the sustainable growth of air travel post-Covid [pandemic]. While uncertainties remain, we are on track to lift production through 2022 to meet our customers’ requirements. At the same time we are preparing the future of aviation, transforming our industrial capabilities and implementing the roadmap for decarbonisation.” Of last year’s deliveries, 533 were single-aisle aircraft, comprising 50 A220-family and 483 A320-family aeroplanes. Widebody airliner deliveries totalled 78, divided into 18 A330-family, 55 A350-family and five A380 aircraft. In 2020, there had been 38 A220-family, 446 A320-family, 19 A330-family, 59 A350-family and four A380 deliveries. In terms of orders, Airbus’ gross intake last year was double that of 2020. Gross orders came to 771 (net orders numbered 507). These were spread across all the group’s programmes and market segments. The A220 family gained 64 firm gross orders, the A320neo (new engine option) family accumulated 661 gross new orders, the A330 family 30 gross new orders and the A350 family 16 gross new orders. Eleven of the A350 orders were for the new A350F dedicated freighter version. As of the end of last year, Airbus had a commercial aircraft backlog of 7 082.
