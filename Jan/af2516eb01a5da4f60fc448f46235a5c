JSE-listed African fuel and lubricants retailer Vivo Energy CFO Doug Lafferty has resigned to take up the position of CFO at Aston Martin Lagonda Group. He will, however, remain a director of Vivo Energy until he leaves, which will be no later than July 31. Lafferty will remain focused on the delivery of the company’s full-year results, due on March 2, as well as on ensuring the effective transition of his responsibilities. The search for a new CFO is under way and the company will announce a further update in due course. “Doug has made a big impact on our business, contributing significantly to the development of our strategy and helping drive the continued recovery following the impacts of Covid-19. The Board and I will be very sad to see him leave and wish him all the best for the future,” says Vivo Energy CEO Christian Chammas. “I’m proud of how the recovery has continued and the strong performance of the company during my tenure,” says Lafferty. “I firmly believe that the strategy is right to provide long-term benefits to our customers and our broader stakeholders, and in the significant long-term potential of Vivo Energy. I look forward to working with Stan Mittelman as he takes over as CEO and wish Vivo Energy all the best for the future,” he says.
