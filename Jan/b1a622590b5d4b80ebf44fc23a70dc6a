Road management company Bakwena N1/N4 Platinum Highway will undertake major rehabilitation of the base layers in the left-hand lane on portions of the N4 between Kameeldrift and Ga-Rankuwa Interchanges as part of its 2022 planned maintenance programme. The detailed design for this work was completed and an 18-month contract was awarded to G4 Civils last year. Work is scheduled to start on January 18, with an expected completion date of June 2023. “The rehabilitation entails extensive removal and reconstruction of layer works, followed by a 40 mm asphalt overlay. During the construction process, the slow lane will be closed in sections, in 5 km lengths for 12-week periods, and traffic capacity will be severely impacted. “Delays can be expected as a result of the lane closures, particularly during peak periods along this section and we urge road users to plan your journeys accordingly to accommodate these delays or make use of alternative routes,” Bakwena warns road users. A second rehabilitation project is scheduled to start on the N1 between Pienaarsrivier and Bela Bela, in July this year. The project is expected to be completed in June 2023. The work entails milling and reconstruction of layer works, followed by a 40 mm asphalt overlay. Lane closures will be in place during this process. “Road user safety remains, as always, our top priority and, in order to ensure this, we rely on road users to partner with us and adhere to the road signs or traffic accommodation in place, and exercise caution and patience while we undertake these critical rehabilitation works,” says Bakwena COO Solomon Kganyago. “Bakwena takes pride in ensuring that the 385 km it manages under its concession contract is maintained to the highest international standards. The upgrades will enhance motorists’ driving experience and improve the overall safety of the road surface,” he adds.
