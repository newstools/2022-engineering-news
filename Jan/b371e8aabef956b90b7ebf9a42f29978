Toyota South Africa Motors (TSAM) last year marked 42 years – out of 61 years in the local market – as the best-selling automotive brand in South Africa, while it also recorded a remarkable market share of 25.4%, up from the 23.7% of 2020. This means that one in every four vehicles sold locally last year was a Toyota product. Out of the industry’s total sales of 464 122 units in 2021, 117 659 units were delivered by TSAM. This is a significant jump from the 90 129 units the local arm of the Japanese manufacturer sold in 2020, but remains well shy of the pre-Covid-19 number of 130 072 units recorded in 2019. The last time TSAM registered a market share higher than 25% was in 2003, which wasn’t necessarily a good year for the local industry as total automotive sales were just above 380 000 units. The made-in-Durban Hilux bakkie retained its title as the country's best-selling vehicle, with a total of 36 085 units sold in 2021, most of which were double-cabs. The locally assembled Hiace minibus taxi also continued its supremacy as the people mover of choice, with a total of 15 699 models sold. These two models, assisted by the Land Cruiser pick-up and Dyna small truck, propelled TSAM to a light commercial vehicle market share of 42.2% in 2021. Toyota’s market share of 19.2% in the passenger segment is the highest in the last 12 years – matching a similar figure in 2018 – and comes in the wake of stellar performances by the locally manufactured Corolla Cross in November and December. Other notable figures were posted by Starlet and Urban Cruiser – 12 103 and 8 899 units, respectively, for 2021. Toyota’s truck division, Hino, posted a market share of 25.1% in the medium commercial vehicle segment, and 5.5% in the heavy commercial vehicle market.
