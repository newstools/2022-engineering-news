Cabinet has approved the roll-out of the second phase of the South Africa (SA) Connect project. The SA Connect plan, the first phase of which piloted the provision of 10 Mb/s broadband services to about 970 critical government facilities, gives effect to the country’s Broadband Policy that was adopted by Cabinet in 2013. The second phase was approved during the Cabinet Lekgotla and special Cabinet meeting held on January 27 and 28. The approved second phase will be rolled out using State-owned entities, such as the State Information Technology Agency, Broadband Infraco and Sentech, and the industry. Over the next 36 months, the project will connect the remaining government facilities, communities and households. The SA Connect project targets achieving 80% broadband access in communities and government facilities over the next three years with a minimum speed capacity of 10 Mb/s and 100 Mb/s for the high-demand facilities, Cabinet said in a statement released post-meeting.
