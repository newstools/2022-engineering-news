Consultancy AmaranthCX has published a new electronic map of the electricity infrastructure in countries that are part of the Southern Africa Power Pool (SAPP) for use with Google Earth or Google Maps. The map geolocates 317 operating power stations across the 11 member countries of SAPP, as well as substations and transmission and distribution lines. The map includes 108 small to large hydroelectric and pumped storage plants, 76 solar photovoltaic projects, 40 wind farms, 85 fossil fuel and biomass thermal power stations, six concentrated solar plants, and nuclear and battery storage sites. The map also shows 175 future, decommissioned and abandoned power stations. AmaranthCX CEO Paul Miller says the map should be of interest to anyone who wants a high-level overview of opportunities in the stressed Southern African electricity industry, including investors, financiers, project developers, suppliers and electricity consumers. The SAPP covers South Africa, Lesotho, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, eSwatini, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Angola, and was established in 1995 with the aim of creating one electricity market for the region.
