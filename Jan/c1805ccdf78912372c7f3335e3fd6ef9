Suzuki Auto South Africa (SASA) saw 67% growth in new-vehicle sales in 2021 as it delivered 27 583 new vehicles to customers, the highest on record for the local arm of the Japanese car manufacturer. SASA reported new-vehicle sales of 16 527 units for 2020. The same year also saw SASA breach the 2 000-unit-sales-a-month level for the first time. Since September last year nearly one in every ten passenger vehicles sold in South Africa is a Suzuki, with SASA in this month also breaking through the 3 000 unit-a-month barrier for the first time. Naamsa | The Automotive Business Council reported that South Africa’s total passenger vehicle market improved by 23.3% in 2021 over the lockdown-restricted market of 2020. Of this, Suzuki accounted for an average of 8.8% of all passenger-vehicle sales, and almost 6% of the total vehicle market. “The past year was filled with many challenges that troubled all vehicle  manufacturers,” says SASA auto dealer sales manager Henno Havenga. “These include significant delays at our main ports, a shortage of vehicles and further lockdown restrictions. “Despite this, the entire team at Suzuki worked extremely hard to source as many vehicles as possible, to design the right product line-up to meet the needs of customers in the current economic climate and to support our dealer network.” “We are working hard with our team at Suzuki’s head office in Japan to make sure that we get as many new vehicles as possible [in 2022] and eliminate or shorten any residual waiting lists that resulted from the disruptions of the last two years,” adds SASA brand marketing manager Brandon Carpenter.
