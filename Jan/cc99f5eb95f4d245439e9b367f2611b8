Prior to the emergence of Omicron, air passenger travel improved in November, with international air passenger demand sustaining a steady upward trend as more markets reopened, reports International Air Transport Association (Iata). The baseline comparison for the data was that of November 2019 – as this was the last normal demand pattern. Domestic air traffic within China, however, weakened in November, largely owing to strengthened travel restrictions in the country. Total demand for air travel in November, measured in revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) was down 47% compared with November 2019 – an uptick compared with October’s 48.9% contraction from October 2019. Domestic air travel within countries deteriorated slightly in November after two consecutive monthly improvements. As such, domestic RPKs fell by 24.9%, compared with a 21.3% decline in October. This was driven primarily by China, where traffic fell 50.9%, after several cities introduced stricter travel restrictions to contain (pre-Omicron) Covid-19 outbreaks. International passenger demand in November was 60.5% below November 2019, improving from the 64.8% decline recorded in October 2021. Iata director-general Willie Walsh says governments over-reacted to the emergence of the Omicron variant at the close of November and resorted to the “tried-and-failed” methods of border closures, excessive testing of travellers and quarantine to slow the spread. “Not surprisingly, international ticket sales in December and early January fell sharply compared to 2019, suggesting a more difficult first quarter than had been expected,” he says. Based on the experience of the past 22 months, Walsh says there is little to no correlation between the introduction of travel restrictions and preventing transmission of the virus across borders. “These measures place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. If experience is the best teacher, let us hope that governments pay more attention as we begin the New Year.” INTERNATIONAL PASSENGER MARKETS African airlines’ traffic fell by 56.8% in November compared with November 2019 – an improvement over the 59.8% decline experienced in October when compared with October 2019.
