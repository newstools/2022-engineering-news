The South African Council for the Project and Construction Management Professions (SACPCMP) is concerned about the collapse of road infrastructure in the Eastern Cape, after a section of the R61 at Tsomo Junction between Ngcobo and Cofimvaba collapsed owing to heavy rainfall towards the end of December. In response to this incident that occurred in the Chris Hani district municipality, the SACPCMP says the appointment of registered professionals on projects is essential in mitigating construction-related disasters in the future. As such, the SACPCMP cautions State-owned entities, government departments and construction firms against the use of people who are not professionally registered. In this regard, the council will, over the next few months, engage with industry stakeholders regarding the importance of using registered professionals to ensure diligently and ethically executed projects. SACPCMP president Isaac Nkosi says the safety of the public is a priority and that, where construction fails to adhere to the highest standards of safety and construction management, a breakdown and total collapse of structures occurs. “To ensure the highest quality of outputs within the built environment, one of the key measures is the engagement of the right participants, including professionals and contractors, from the very beginning of all projects,” he adds. Nkosi says registered professionals provide the necessary experience, qualifications and skills required to ensure projects are executed within the set timeframes and budgets; and to standards that guarantee sustainability, proper functionality and safety of these structures. Further, he states that clients and registered professionals appointed on construction projects should be held accountable for substandard work in the project and construction management, and construction health and safety professions. “Professionals are required to comply with a code of conduct as part of their professional registration and thus, are accountable for their actions in terms of the requirements of the code,” he adds.
