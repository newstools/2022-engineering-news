Packaging and paper manufacturer Mondi says it is accelerating its plans to reduce its carbon emissions by committing to transition to net zero by 2050. The group plans to expand on almost two decades of such progress, including a 45% reduction in specific greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions against a 2004 baseline and science-based targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2019. Mondi CEO Andrew King says the climate crisis is the most urgent risk facing society and businesses must take decisive action to mitigate their impact. “Mondi has a long record of investing in our operations to reduce our GHG emissions and the board’s approval of our new net-zero plan reinforces our commitment to contributing to a better world.” He adds that the adoption of science-based targets in line with an increase of no greater than 1.5 °C above pre-industrial era levels is an important milestone in Mondi’s journey to net zero. However, King points out that taking action today is an “absolute imperative” and Mondi has a “clear roadmap” to achieve its 2025 milestones. Mondi’s net-zero plan, which was developed to align with SBTi’s new Net-Zero Standard, commits to reducing GHG emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 in line with a 1.5 oC scenario. Mondi submitted its net-zero commitment to the SBTi in December and has signed up to the United Nations Business Ambition for 1.5 oC – a large and fast-growing group of companies committed to taking urgent climate action aligned with 1.5 oC. Mondi group sustainable development head Gladys Naylor says that, while Mondi works with SBTi to validate its new targets, the company is taking action by doing the long-term planning to achieve its commitments, working every day to ensure that it is on track to meet its milestones in line with its MAP2030 sustainability framework.
