The US Mission to South Africa has opened applications for its Fulbright scholarship programme. The Fulbright Foreign Student Program is a competitive scholarship that funds postgraduate study in the US. South African citizens and permanent residents can apply for a Fulbright scholarship to complete a master’s or doctoral degree at any accredited tertiary institution in the US. Fulbright scholarships cover the full cost of tuition and living expenses in the US for up to two years. In partnership with South Africa’s National Research Foundation (NRF), the Fulbright programme also offers scholarships to South African PhD students enrolled at South African universities to conduct one year’s research at a US university as a visiting student researcher (VSR). “Over 2 100 South Africans have received Fulbright scholarships to date, and after completing their studies, Fulbrighters have returned to South Africa where they have made a huge difference in their communities and transferred skills that continue to contribute to the development and economic growth of South Africa. “We encourage talented South African students, graduates and young professionals to apply for this once-in-a-lifetime academic exchange programme and to join the Fulbright family of changemakers,” says US Mission to South Africa Public Affairs Minister Counsellor Frank Whitaker. Applications for the Fulbright Foreign Student Program will close on May 1. South Africans wishing to pursue a master’s degree must have completed a four-year B-Tech degree or a three-year bachelor’s degree with an Honours degree. Prospective doctoral students must have successfully obtained a master’s degree. Successful applicants will start their Fulbright studies in August 2023. Medical studies or research requiring direct patient contact, and MBA studies, are not funded by the Fulbright scholarship. The US government strongly encourages applications from students with disabilities and from underserved areas.
