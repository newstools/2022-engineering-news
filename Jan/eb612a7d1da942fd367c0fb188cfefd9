Air Seychelles announced on Friday that it was going to increase the number of its flights between its home base at Seychelles International Airport at the country’s capital of Mahé, and Johannesburg’s OR Tambo International Airport, starting early next month. With effect from February 3, the island group’s national flag carrier will operate two flights a week between the two locations, on Thursdays and Sundays. Moreover, the airline is planning to restore air connectivity to the Maldives early in March. This will allow passengers from Johannesburg to more easily access the Maldives and increase their tropical island holiday destination options, the airline pointed out. Maldives flights should recommence on March 4. The Johannesburg-Mahé flights will be operated by Air Seychelles’ Airbus latest generation A320-200neo (neo standing for new engine option) single-aisle airliners. The airline operates two of these aircraft. The Johannesburg-Mahé flights will be coded HM060 and will leave OR Tambo International at 13h50, arriving in the Seychelles at 20h45. The Mahé-Johannesburg flights will be coded HM061 and depart at 09h25 and arrive in Johannesburg at 12h30. Passengers on the Sunday flights from Johannesburg will be able to seamlessly connect with flights from Mahé to Mumbai in India. The stopover at Mahé will be less than two hours. “Amidst the unprecedented environment, travellers are encouraged to follow all regulations prior to departure and at the country of destination,” stated the airline. “In the meantime, Air Seychelles will continue to monitor its performance to rebuild its network and offer more options as travel confidence returns.” In addition to its A320neos, the airline also operates five 19-seat Viking Air DHC-6 Twin Otter 400 twin turboprops, which serve its domestic routes.
