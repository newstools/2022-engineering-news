Telecommunications giant MTN has been named South Africa’s best network after securing the highest score in Rohde & Schwarz SwissQual’s Network Performance Score findings. MTN ranked first in quality and performance with a score of 763 out of 1 000 points, ahead of the 722 achieved by its nearest competitor. The company also outperformed in the data services score, achieving 421 out of 600 for data, compared with the 373 achieved by its nearest competitor. The Rohde & Schwarz drive-test-based data collection campaign was implemented from October 4 to December 8 and covered South Africa’s major cities, towns and roads. During this period there were significant periods of load-shedding and load reduction and this impact is included in these performance scores. Over 18 600 voice calls and over 125 400 individual data service tests were performed to calculate a Network Performance Score in line with ETSI TR 103 559. “The quality of experience delivered to our customers is very important to MTN. We are consistently working to upgrade and modernise our network infrastructure to ensure customers enjoy the best user experience, and results such as these work to help us benchmark ourselves against the quality and competitive position of other networks, using the scores as a basis to deliver optimal quality of experience to our customers,” said MTN South Africa corporate affairs executive Jacqui O’Sullivan. “For us, a high-performing network means connecting the previously unconnected; enhanced connectivity for those already connected; and more digital opportunities for all, enabling customers to take advantage of the range of applications that are available on the market today – and we will keep working to ensure this access continues,” she concluded.
