The Western Cape Human Settlements Department has launched its contractors' framework, which aims to target particularly women- and youth-owned contractors. The department is inviting bids from engineering and construction contractors owned by historically disadvantaged individuals (HDIs) to participate. A framework agreement to be entered into by the department and successful contractors will be applicable for three years. The successful contractors will then be eligible to submit quotations for contracts issued by the department. The scope of engineering and construction work includes general building; civil engineering; electrical engineering works – building; electrical engineering works – infrastructure; landscaping, irrigation and horticulture; and steel security fencing or precast concrete fencing. “I’m excited about the launch of this framework, as it demonstrates our continued commitment to empowering our HDIs. We’ve already shown that we invest in the empowerment of our contractors by spending more than 50% of our Human Settlement Development Grant on their development. "With this historic initiative, we’re taking it a step further, as this will ensure that more contractors have access to these types of opportunities.” Western Cape Human Settlements Minister Tertuis Simmers says. Interested parties have until 11:00 on February 25 to submit bids. For more information, click here.
