The City of Johannesburg (CoJ) will host three public engagement sessions from July 26 to 28 to discuss an urban development framework (UDF) for the Frankenwald area, between Buccleuch, Kelvin, Alexandra and Linbro Park. The first engagement, on July 26, will be hosted in the East Bank Hall in Alexandra, the second virtually on Microsoft Teams, on July 27, and the third in the Marlboro Community Centre, in Marlboro Gardens, on July 28. Frankenwald Developments (FD) has started with a spatial planning process, with the UDF due to be adopted as CoJ policy once the public participation process concludes and the framework is approved by the city’s council. The Frankenwald site is one of the few remaining undeveloped and centrally located sites within Johannesburg and the CoJ believes it has the potential to become a place of significance within the city and Gauteng. FD plans on transforming the area into an urban settlement served by integrated public transport services, which will help to eradicate social and geographic divides in the city, where people live far from employment opportunities. “We have taken on the challenge of developing higher density through introducing affordable housing opportunities in well located land in the city to support positive social, economic and spatial integration,” says Development Planning MMC Belinda Echeozonjoku.
