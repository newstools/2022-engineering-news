The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has become a member of the Metal Industry and Engineering Bargaining Council (MEIBC) after completing a membership verification process. The union extended its scope in 2020 and amalgamated with the Liberated Metalworkers' Union of South Africa in 2021. As a result, workers have been joining the union in significant numbers, which led to its application, in March, to join the MEIBC. "The NUM is delighted with the fact that members in the sector shall have a new voice . . . in addressing multiple challenges confronting workers. We are also committed to working with progressive organisations in the Council to advance the interest of our members," the union says.
