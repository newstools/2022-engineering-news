The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has signed an above-inflation wage agreement with Eskom’s wholly-owned construction, maintenance and transportation services subsidiary Eskom Rotek Industries (ERI). The wage agreement – valid for a year and expiring on June 30, 2023 – entitles all bargaining unit-affiliated ERI employees a 7% increase in basic salaries across the board, effective June 30. Employees’ housing allowance will increase by R400  to R3 825, while maternity leave will be extended from four to five months. However, Numsa notes that its task teams have been assigned to deal with specific issues such as the eradication of T02 and T03 salary scales, introducing parental and adoption leave, a long service increment, introducing a transportation bonus and increasing maternity leave to six months.
