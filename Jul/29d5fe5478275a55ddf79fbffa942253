Less than five years since the launch of the current Polo model, Volkswagen Group South Africa (VWSA) has seen the 500 000th unit roll off the production line at its Kariega plant, in the Eastern Cape. The current Polo was launched in January, 2018, with a refreshed model introduced  at the start of this year. The 500 000th unit, a white left-hand-drive GTI which will be exported to France, also marked the 4 202 260thvehicle built at the Kariega plant to date, which means the current Polo model accounts for almost 12% of all vehicles built here since 1948. Of the 500 000 Polo units, 90 004 were built for the local market and 409 996 were destined for export markets. Included in this are 77 397 units of the facelifted Polo. VWSA currently exports the Polo built in Kariega to 38 countries. The local arm of the German car maker builds the vehicle for all right-hand-drive markets, while also supplementing production for left-hand-drive markets. The Kariega plant is also the sole manufacturer worldwide of the Polo GTI. “As VWSA, and one of only two plants worldwide building this vehicle, we are proud to achieve the half-million mark,” says VWSA production director Ulrich Schwabe. “Despite difficult circumstances in the industry and the global community, the VWSA family has persevered to bring us this milestone. Just as we faced the challenges as a team, we will celebrate this achievement – and many more to follow – as a team.”
