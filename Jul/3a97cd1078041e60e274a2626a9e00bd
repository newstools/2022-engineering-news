KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala at the weekend launched Phase 1 of the M4 road reconstruction project and reopened the M4 uMdloti River bridge, near La Mercy. The bridge was reopened following extensive repairs after it was damaged in the April floods.

The reopening of the bridge will ease traffic movement from the N2 uMdloti offramp at La Mercy to Westbrook. 

The Premier said the provincial government’s main priority is to repair the destroyed roads and infrastructure, as well as secure suitable land to build proper houses for displaced families, who are currently housed in mass care centres.

Sections of the M4 that are still closed for ongoing repairs are expected to be reopened in the next few weeks.
