Consulting, assurance, tax and transaction services company EY has called for nominations for entrepreneurial South Africans and those from other African countries to enter the World Entrepreneur Award Southern Africa programme, which is in its twenty-fifth year. Winners are provided with an ecosystem of consulting, strategy and assurance required to radically scale their businesses across Africa and the world, with the awards offering more than just recognition through a range of award categories, EY Africa CEO Ajen Sita says. “Entrepreneurs are rapidly reshaping the world and no more so than in Africa. This year, we hope to attract more women-led businesses in particular. Women in Southern Africa have provided inspiration in reframing our future and have tackled some of the world’s most intractable problems through innovation,” he adds. Eligible entrepreneurs include founders of companies and those who organise, manage and assume the risks of a business or enterprise early in a company’s life and are still active in the leadership of the company. Entrepreneurs can also be multi-generational businesses with the current CEO continuing to manage the business, EY says. Since 1998, EY’s World Entrepreneur Award Southern Africa has honoured people who build and lead successful, growing and dynamic businesses. The overall winners are then invited to compete for the prestigious EY World Entrepreneur Of The Year title, in Monte Carlo, in June each year, which includes entrepreneurs from 60 countries. Nominations for the World Entrepreneur Award Southern Africa programme close in August.
