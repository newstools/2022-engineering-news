From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: With a growing requirement to do more with less, contractors can now take advantage of industrial machinery company Metso Outotec’s Lokotrack ST2.3 scalping screen, the versatility of which enables contractors to adapt the machine and deliver their desired results on a variety of applications. Simone Liedtke, who attended the launch event, tells us more. Simone Liedtke: Pilot Crushtec now distributes the scalping screen locally and is confident that the machine will enable entry-level and medium-scale contractors to “deliver services reliably to the African market”. The company’s Francois Marais tells us about the relationship between Metso Outotec and Pilot Crushtec, and highlights some of the scalping screen’s unique features. Pilot Crushtec sales and marketing director Francois Marais: Simone Liedtke: The scalping screen has been available globally for the past few years but has only recently arrived on South African shores. Pilot Crushtec sales and marketing director Francois Marais: Simone Liedtke: Considering that contractors can now cost-effectively transfer productivity from one job site to the next, despite the change in operating conditions, the Lokotrack offers junior- and small-scale miners an easier entry to market.
