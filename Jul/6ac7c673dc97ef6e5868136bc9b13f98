ParkUpp has secured community basement parking for car collectors in a number of locations across South Africa. Parkupp Collector’s national roll-out begins at Cape Town’s Cape Quarter with an initial 40-bay offering. A simple click-book-and-park should be sufficient to have one's collectable car safely parked alongside others. "You may own that polished collectible for the sheer joy of an occasional drive, as an investment, or as functional art,” says ParkUpp’s Umar Obaray. “It might be a rare find or a sentimental reminder of times past. For most enthusiasts, however, there is always the question of where to park it. “Once the bug has bitten and you have more cars than your home garage can accommodate, the search for offsite parking begins. "There are specialised facilities whose offerings include climate control and concierge services, often with accompanying waiting lists as demand is strong,” notes Obaray. “For the average collector, however, looking to house a car under cover, arranging parking in a friend's garage or basement of a building is a hassle. “Multiply this inconvenience by two to three cars and it will significantly detract from the joy of collecting. “Therefore it makes sense to cultivate communities of collectors and for them to cluster their cars in dedicated basements,” says Obaray.
