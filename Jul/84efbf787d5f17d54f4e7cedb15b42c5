Eris Property Group and Rosslyn Hub Development Company have announced that construction work has started on a 25 000 m2 manufacturing facility for BMW supplier, YFPO, in Rosslyn, Tshwane. BMW Group South Africa produces the X3 at its Rosslyn plant for the local and export markets. YFPO is a joint venture (JV) between Plastic Omnium, a French automotive company and Yanfeng, a Chinese automotive company. The JV currently operates 27 plants and employs more than 4 700 people around the world. The Rosslyn facility will be the JV’s first investment in Africa. The YFPO building will be owned and developed by Eris Property Group. Pieter Gouws, the development manager of Eris in charge of the development, has confirmed that the project is subject to “extremely tight deadlines” to achieve BMW’s manufacturing timelines. As such the project is receiving high-level facilitation support from both the Automotive Industry Development Centre and the City of Tshwane. “We are extremely excited to be developing this state-of-the-art building for YFPO and to contribute in a small way to the increase of foreign direct investment and job creation in South Africa and specifically the City of Tshwane,” says Gouws.
