An application to appeal the rejection of an environmental authorisation for Eskom’s Kendal power station to extend the life of its ash dump to 30 years has been set aside by the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE) for reconsideration. The Kendal power station applied for the extension of life of its ash disposal facility, but it was rejected in April 2021, following which Eskom, in May 2021, lodged an appeal against the rejection as per requirements of the Appeals Regulations. On June 2, Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment Minister Barbara Creecy upheld Eskom’s appeal, while the initial integrated environmental authorisation chief director’s decision to refuse the authorisation is set aside. As such, the matter is remitted to the DFFE for reconsideration of the environmental assessment applications.
