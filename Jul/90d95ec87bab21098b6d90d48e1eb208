Electronics company LG Electronics, in partnership with the Society of Air-conditioning and Refrigerating Engineers of Korea (SAREK), is hosting this year’s heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) Design Award. The HVAC Design Award is a competitive platform that invites companies, designers and consultants in the industry to compete on a global scale to showcase their innovative ideas. This year, the competition extends to Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The award also gives contestants – of all experience levels – an opportunity to access HVAC-related clients and showcase their work. “The award provides an impressive platform for HVAC designers, consultants and companies to express the value of optimised and efficient HVAC design. “At the end of the day, these designs should understand the needs and pain points of the end-user business, suggest appropriate solutions that add value through distinctive quantitative benefits and, ultimately, realise satisfaction to HVAC customers,” explains LG HVAC engineering sales team leader Prabhjeet Singh Channa. Teams can register on the HVAC Design Award website before July 31. Thereafter, projects will be submitted, and the first evaluation will take place on September 16 on a national level. Regional evaluation will follow on September 30 and the announcement of the winning team will be made in October. All participants will be awarded small products from LG Electronics and winners will be awarded LG Electronics home appliances according to their rankings and countries. Travel vouchers will also be up for grabs for winning teams. Winning teams will be eligible for gold, silver and bronze awards, which range in prize earnings. The gold winning team will receive $30 000 (about R500 000) in LG products or vouchers; the four silver winning teams will receive $3 000 (about R50 000) in LG products or vouchers; and the nine bronze winning teams will receive $1 500 (about R25 000) in LG products or vouchers.
