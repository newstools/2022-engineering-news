South African private-sector regional airline Airlink has announced that it is instituting a new route, linking Johannesburg in South Africa to Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. The new route has been approved by the aviation authorities in both countries and the service, which will be daily, will start operating on August 15. “Victoria Falls is a jewel in the region’s tourism crown and Airlink is looking forward to re-establishing connectivity between the attraction and Johannesburg,” highlighted Airlink CEO and MD Rodger Foster. “This brand new Airlink route will be our second to Victoria Falls, which we already serve from Cape Town.” The flights from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls will be coded 4Z 494, and depart at 11h30, arriving at Victoria Falls at 13h15. The flights from Victoria Falls to Johannesburg will be coded 4Z 495 and depart at 13h55 and reach Johannesburg at 15h35. The flights will be operated with Embraer E-190 jet airliners, configured with 98 seats. The flight schedules were designed to ensure convenient connections with other Airlink services from and to Johannesburg (its main base), as well as with international services provided by Airlink’s global airline partners. “In addition, we provide direct flights connecting Harare with Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban and between Bulawayo and Johannesburg,” he highlighted. “With the recent introduction of long-haul flights from Europe directly to Victoria Falls, our services allow customers arriving on those flights to conveniently include South African destinations in their travel.” Airlink was created in 1992. With a fleet of more than 50 modern jet airliners, it serves more than 45 destinations in 13 countries across Southern Africa, plus St Helena Island. And it will resume services to Madagascar, once that country lifts its current flight restrictions. It is a member of the International Air Transport Association (Iata) and is accredited under the Iata Operational Safety Audit.
