Trade, Industry and Competition Minister Ebrahim Patel has confirmed that government will share the findings of research conducted into the impact of black industrialists on economic output and job numbers during the inaugural Black Industrialists and Exporters Conference. The conference will be hosted on July 20 in Sandton and will serve to reflect on the performance of government’s Black Industrialists Programme since its inception in 2016. Patel says the conference will also help to identify what more can be done to strengthen government’s efforts to advance black industrialists – particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. The conference will comprise a keynote address by President Cyril Ramaphosa; a number of panel discussions; the launch of growth initiatives, such as the Black Exporters Network; a marketplace with 85 businesses showcasing products; and ten Presidential Awards that will be issued for excellence in business. Patel explains that the President will announce ten awards for black businesses making contributions to innovation and exports, as well as successful localisation of historically imported products. The awards will also recognise young and female industrialists, respectively. The Minister admits that government does not create industrialists, but rather the enabling, or the inhibiting, environment, whatever the case may be, for them to kickstart businesses, which government hopes to better appraise at the conference.
