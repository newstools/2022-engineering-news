South African carrier South African Airways (SAA) and Kenya national carrier Kenya Airways (KQ) have signed a codeshare agreement that opens more destinations for travel opportunities. As demand for air travel rebounds, the code-sharing agreement will see each airline sell, under its own code, flights operated by each other. SAA’s customers will continue to have the ability to earn Voyager Miles on these new codeshare flights. The deal enables travellers to combine flight segments and baggage on a single ticket. Passengers travelling out of South Africa will have more options to travel to African destinations including Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, Entebbe, Mombasa and Kisumu, while KQ passengers will have more choices for travel into Southern Africa including Cape Town, Durban and Harare. The growth of the partnership will see the addition of Zanzibar, Kilimanjaro, Juba, Douala, Lusaka, Ghana and Nigeria subject to government approval as the airlines seek to offer more options for travellers within Africa. Additional codeshare destinations are being evaluated between the partners and will be announced in due course. In November 2021, KQ and SAA signed a strategic partnership framework to work together to increase passenger traffic, cargo opportunities and general trade by taking advantage of strengths in South Africa, Kenya and the rest of Africa. This codeshare agreement builds on an existing special prorate agreement which was signed earlier this year. The carriers are also exploring ways to enhance cooperation on their respective frequent flyer programmes, including reciprocal earning and redemption opportunities and popular benefits such as lounge access.
