Aircraft charter and aviation services company ExecuJet South Africa, part of the Luxembourg-based Luxaviation group, has highlighted that it will be showcasing the latest addition to its aircraft fleet, a Beechcraft King Air 260, at the AERO South Africa exhibition and air show, currently being held at Wonderboom National Airport in Pretoria. The King Air 260 is a twin-turboprop small passenger aircraft. “The Beechcraft King Air 260 is such a popular aircraft with the business community globally, and we’ll be offering this turboprop for charter in Africa for the first time,” said Luxaviation VP: Africa Gavin Kiggen. “New from the factory in 2022, and able to carry up to eight passengers, the aircraft will be based at Lanseria International Airport, near Johannesburg. From there, we’re expecting high demand for flights to locations including Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe.” According to its manufacturer, the King Air has a maximum range of 1 720 nautical miles, and has a maximum cruise speed of 310 knots (nautical miles per hour), or 574 km/h. It can carry a ‘useful load’ of 3 760 lb (1 706 kg) and can reach a maximum altitude of 10 668 m (35 000 ft). It is powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-52 turboprop engines, each with an output of 634 kW. It will not be the only new aircraft joining the ExecuJet Africa fleet this year. “We also have a long-range jet from the Bombardier series joining later this year and we know the large-cabin comfort and range will be highly attractive to charter customers across Africa,” he reported. AERO South Africa, described by Kiggen as “this industry-leading general aviation trade show” opened on Thursday and will close on Saturday. More than 100 companies are exhibiting at this year’s show, with more than 4 000 visitors expected.
