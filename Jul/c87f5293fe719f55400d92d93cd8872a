A new 15 megalitre water reservoir has been launched for Lenasia and surrounding communities to improve storage capacity of the Lenasia High Level Reservoir and to ensure reliability of clean water supply. The R45-million multi-faceted project, which started in August 2020, included site clearing, earthworks, layer works, pipe trenching, pipe bedding and the construction of the 15 megalitre concrete reservoir. “The timeous delivery of the Lenasia Reservoir is another concrete example of the repair and rebuild the multi-party government is undertaking in order to establish the economic capital of the country as a City of Golden Opportunities,” said Johannesburg Executive Mayor Mpho Phalatse during the launch this week. “The Lenasia Reservoir is one of many infrastructure-upgrade projects that the Johannesburg multi-party government is undertaking to ensure access to quality sustainable basic services to all six-million residents.” This aligns with the mayoral priority number one of “getting the basics right” by ensuring that there is clean water and a sanitary environment for every community. During the project, R13-million of the project funding was apportioned to local small, medium-sized and microenterprises – with a particular emphasis on skills transfer – while R1.2-million has been spent in the past two years alone on local labour, creating 17 jobs. Meanwhile, Joburg Water will start the rollout of more projects to the benefit of residents, worth R930-million, for water supply and sewer infrastructure, after the Johannesburg multi-party government’s R77.3-billion 2022/23 budget takes effect on July 1.
