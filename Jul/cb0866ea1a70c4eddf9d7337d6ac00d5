Power utility Eskom says it continues to replace mini substations and transformers that failed or exploded as a result of theft, vandalism and network overloading in Gauteng. The overloading is the result of illegal connections, meter tampering, unauthorised operations, nonpayment and electricity token purchases from ghost vendors, the utility notes. It reiterates that there is a shortage of mini substations and transformers as a result of the high number of failed and exploded electricity equipment. This makes it difficult to meet demand. The utility calls on communities to prevent the premature failure of electrical equipment by refraining for conducting illegal electricity-related acts.
