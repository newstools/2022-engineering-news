Stage 1 load-shedding will be implemented from 16:00 to 24:00 on Friday evening. Load-shedding will then be suspended as the generation system has recovered sufficiently at this point. "Eskom thanks the public and all stakeholders for their patience and understanding during this difficult period of load-shedding. While we are able to suspend load-shedding at this point, Eskom cautions that the power system constraints continue to persist," Eskom said in a statement. Eskom has 3 693MW on planned maintenance, while another 14 261MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns.
