Emerging integrated energy producer Renergen has achieved the natural gas to plant milestone at its Virginia project, in South Africa’s Free State province. Gas to plant was achieved on July 8 and signified by the opening of the main inlet line from the gas gathering system to the process plant and then to the natural gas filtration and pre-compression system, the company explains. The key objective of introducing gas to plant was to ensure the plant safety systems could be verified under controlled conditions, before moving into various areas of the process plant. The full commissioning and operational testing of the emergency and operational flare systems were also completed, which is the first integrated run between the pipeline system and process plant. Renergen says the flare system tests included pilot and igniter operation and functional tests, using product from the process plant. Tests also included the wet gas knockout testing and water collection and recirculation systems. Final commissioning workstreams will be completed over the coming weeks, with commercial operations starting once customer sites are ready to begin accepting product. Renergen expects this to occur towards the end of July. “Successful introduction of gas to plant at our world-class Virginia gas project is an incredible achievement and testament to the hard work and commitment of the entire team,” CEO Stefano Marani enthuses. “This major milestone has been a long time coming and I am incredibly proud of the efficient progression and success of the company since acquiring this unknown greenfield asset only a few years ago.” He adds that the company has worked towards positioning the Virginia gas project as a globally significant liquefied natural gas and helium producer, adding that the company is “very close to delivering on this goal”.
