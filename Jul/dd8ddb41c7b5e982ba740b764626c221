Ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s much-anticipated announcement of a comprehensive plan for tackling load-shedding, electricity industry veteran Vally Padayachee has drafted an ‘A-to-Z’ guideline for addressing the crisis over the coming two years. Padayachee, who has 40 years of energy experience and is currently strategic adviser to the Association of Municipal Electricity Utilities, has drafted the proposed interventions in his personal capacity. The paper calls for urgent action to arrest what is described as a fast accelerating downward spiral precipitated by the poor performance of Eskom’s coal fleet, including the newly introduced coal capacity at Medupi and Kusile, and insufficient new generation from non-Eskom sources. To address the crisis in the short term, which Padayachee defines as being a two-year period, the following 26, labelled from A-to-Z, recommendations have been made: Padayachee believes the crisis has reached a point whereby a ‘carpe electron’ (seize the electron) rallying of business, community, government and organised labour behind the common goals of arresting Eskom’s downward spiral and stopping the load-shedding. He is not alone in making a call for the declaration of an emergency, with the National Planning Commission having done likewise, together with various other commentators and industry experts. In addition, Cape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis has published a 10-point plan for ending load-shedding, which also emphasises the need to lift red tape, for tax incentives and for easing the constraints on municipalities to enable them to procure electricity form IPPs. Hill-Lewis has also called for the conversion of Eskom’s diesel-fuelled Ankerlig plant in Atlantis, Cape Town, to natural gas and to run the plant on a mid-merit basis, with dynamic output adjusted according to fluctuations in demand.
