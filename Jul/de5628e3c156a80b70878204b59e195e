The Automotive Manufacturers Employers Association (AMEO) and the National Union of Metalworkers South Africa (Numsa) this week started wage negotiations in the vehicle assembly sector. AMEO consists of Toyota, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Ford and Isuzu. AMEO and Numsa in 2019 signed a three-year wage agreement. That was the third time negotiations within the vehicle manufacturing industry were concluded without industrial action.
