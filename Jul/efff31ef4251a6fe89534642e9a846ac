The Richards Bay Bulk Terminal loaded 192 400 t of magnetite in a single vessel last week, as the 300-m-long MV Seacon Africa sailed for China a day ahead of schedule. This was the largest magnetite consignment in the history of the terminal’s operations. The operational team averaged a loading rate of 1 699 t/h throughout the vessels’ five days, 54% above the normal loading rate. “We loaded MV Seacon Africa consistently and with little delays, thanks to the leadership of the terminal manager and his team, as well as the cooperation between ourselves and the Palabora Mining Company team we have executed with,” says newly appointed Richards Bay Terminals managing executive Kwazi Mabaso. Thirty-nine magnetite trains pulling 80 wagons each were offloaded at a cycle of 18 wagons an hour through the terminal’s Tippler 2, which underwent refurbishments two years ago. Yearly, the Richards Bay Bulk Terminal handles about five-million tonnes of magnetite, one of seven key commodities. Of the network of 16 sea-cargo and three inland terminals managed by Transnet Port Terminals (TPT), the Richards Bay Bulk Terminal is the only magnetite operation within the stable. Magnetite exports have increased, as the iron oxide serves as a crucial ingredient in the manufacturing of steel.
