The Water Research Commission (WRC) and the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef) have signed a new memorandum of understanding (MoU), formalising a partnership in the areas of citizen science, water quality and water, sanitation and hygiene (Wash). After meeting in December 2021 to explore this cooperation, the parties' interest evolved into joint projects and activities in the areas of water resources and ecosystems, climate change, food systems and nutrition, and youth and sanitation in the Southern African region and beyond. The MoU, which aims to facilitate, support and implement these joint activities, was signed on July 22 at WRC's offices in Pretoria. The formalisation of the partnership will also provide a framework to plan and implement joint water and sanitation research and innovation programmes, projects and activities related to youth and children's wellbeing. The WRC and Unicef have already jointly implemented a number of activities together, including a community roadshow on international cooperation and best practice on citizen science engagement in water and sanitation programmes, projects and activities. The two organisations will cooperate in collaborative research in areas of mutual interest to be agreed during the technical steering committee meetings; knowledge exchange through study visits, workshops, dialogues and activities, with a special focus on children, youth, women and other vulnerable groups; capacity building to bridge the skills gaps through training and educational programmes, with a special focus on children, youth, women, and other vulnerable groups; and solution demonstration through support to proof of concept and modelling of new technologies and solutions in Africa. The MoU will run for an indefinite period.
