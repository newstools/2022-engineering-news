The board of Mhlathuze Water has resolved to take disciplinary action against its CEO and CFO on charges of financial misconduct and maladministration following an intensive investigation commissioned by the board in December 2021. The investigation was initiated after whistle-blower allegations implicating the CEO Mthokozisi Duze and CFO Babongile Mnyandu were brought to its attention. The two executives were subsequently put on precautionary suspension to allow for an investigation to start and would remain on suspension until the disciplinary process had been concluded, said Mhlathuze Water Board chairperson Thabi Shange, adding that, as per the recommendations of the investigation, an independent disciplinary process will ensue in the coming weeks. “The board has acted based on the recommendations of an investigation which found that the two executives had flouted aspects of the Public Finance Management Act. We have reviewed the charges brought against the executives and believe there is sufficient ground to institute disciplinary proceedings.” In a separate investigation, four other officials from the supply chain management and technical services department were also put on precautionary suspension. Swaswa Ntlhoro and Thokozane Hlongwane will continue in their roles as interim CEO and CFO, respectively, to ensure that Mhlathuze Water’s mandate of delivering bulk water and wastewater services to municipalities and industries in northern KwaZulu-Natal continues unhindered.
