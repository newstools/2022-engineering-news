The chairperson of the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa), Dr Keabetswe Modimoeng, is stepping down, citing a need to take some time off after an enervating period. Modimoeng tendered his resignation on Wednesday and will now start serving notice to ensure a smooth handover, with assurances that the transition period will be seamless and that proper continuity is guaranteed during the handover period. His resignation is being processed through the relevant appointing authorities. Modimoeng, who will, after a much-needed break, consider future options, joined Icasa in April 2016 and has served as a councillor, acting chairperson and duly appointed chairperson, as well as in various committees of the council, including as a member of the complaints and compliance committee. “The Icasa council and management would like to thank Dr Modimoeng for his steady and decisive leadership, guidance and attention to governance over the years - yielding success in moments where some milestones practically seemed impossible,” the authority said in a statement. “The undisputed highlight of his decisive leadership in the sector has been steering the authority towards the successful conclusion of the complex and historic spectrum auction licensing process.” While awaiting the completion of the process for appointment of four additional members, Icasa continues to be led by a strong team comprising the remaining four councillors who will continue to receive the support of management and the entire organisation.
