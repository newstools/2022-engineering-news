Industry organisation the Engineering Council of South Africa (ECSA) has elected Thembinkosi Madikane VP. "The election of Madikane, who is a professional engineer, seeks to ensure that the council is well capacitated to fulfil its strategic role of overseeing the implementation of the 2020 to 2025 ECSA Strategic Plan, which was approved to ensure that ECSA becomes an effective regulator assuring engineering excellence," the organisation says. Madikane has served on many ECSA structures, including the High Impact Committees and has also served as a reviewer, assessor, moderator and trainer, as well as on the accreditation visits. He is also currently ECSA Continuous Professional Development Committee chairperson. Further, between 2009 to 2012, he served on the ECSA council and, in 2016, became the president of the South African Institute of Electrical Engineers, which is one of the largest voluntary associations recognised by ECSA. Also in 2016, Madikane played an active role in ensuring robust engagements between ECSA and voluntary associations. "Madikane has represented ECSA on the International Engineering Alliance activities over many years and, in 2020, he was re-elected to serve on the ECSA sixth-term council. "He takes over the baton as VP from Refilwe Buthelezi, who was recently elected ECSA president. They will provide strategic leadership to steer ECSA and the engineering industry in South Africa to greater heights," the organisation says.
