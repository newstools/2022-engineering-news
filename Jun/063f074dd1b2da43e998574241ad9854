Earthmoving and energy supply organisation Barloworld Equipment UK has issued its subsidiary Barzem Enterprises with a notice to terminate the companies’ Caterpillar distribution agreement, from September 30. Barzem had been a distributor for equipment brand Caterpillar in Zimbabwe to date, however, Barloworld has decided to manage the Caterpillar distributorship in the country independently. Barloworld Equipment CEO Emmy Leeka says this is a result of Barloworld’s growth strategy having culminated in changes to the company’s strategic direction and plans for business expansion in the area. “Even with the long-standing dealership arrangement coming to an end, Barloworld will forge ahead as the sole dealer and distributor of Caterpillar in Zimbabwe,” Leeka adds, confirming that the termination of the dealership agreement does not compromise the company’s ability to deliver world-class Caterpillar solutions to local customers.
