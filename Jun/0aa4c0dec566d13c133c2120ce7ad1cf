Stage 6 load-shedding will kick in again from 16:00 until 22:00 on Wednesday evening, Eskom said in a statement. This is despite the fact that striking employees have started returning to work. Stage 4 load-shedding will be implemented from 22:00 until midnight, and then reduced to Stage 2 until 05:00 on Thursday morning. From 05:00 until 00:00 on Thursday load-shedding will be at Stage 4. Stage 2 load-shedding will be implemented from midnight until 05:00 on Friday morning. "While some workers have started reporting for duty at the power stations, there is still a high level of absenteeism. As a result of the unlawful strike, routine maintenance work has had to be postponed. This backlog will take days to weeks to clear," Eskom said. "It is therefore important to note that the system will remain constrained and vulnerable to additional breakdowns while recovery activities are in progress. Due to the unlawful and unprotected labour action, which has caused widespread disruption to Eskom’s power plants, Eskom is unable to return some generators to service. This has compelled Eskom to continue taking precautionary measures to conserve emergency generation capacity and safeguard plant from damage." The utility currently has 3 161MW on planned maintenance, while another 17 395MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns.
