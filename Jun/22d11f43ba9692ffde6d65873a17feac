Alternative investment fund manager Anuva Investments is seeking to collaborate with industry experts and reputable engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) partners to fund solar photovoltaic (PV) projects in the agricultural, commercial and industrial, as well as residential space. To supplement its existing agriculture-focussed solar PV project pipeline with projects in the Western Cape and North West provinces, Anuva will continue to source and secure new technical partners in other sectors. CIO Zane de Decker says that, because Africa is “blessed with abundant solar energy resources”, Anuva’s current focus is on solar, while it also places importance on partnering with the right people to expand the company’s solar portfolio. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that, by 2026, global renewable energy capacity will rise by more than 60% from 2020 levels and account for nearly 95% of all worldwide power capacity growth in that time. According to the IEA, solar PV remains the powerhouse of growth in renewable electricity throughout the world, and the solar PV industry in particular in South Africa is growing steadily. “Each of our PV solar projects is part of our strategic imperative to support sustainable industry, reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and increase reliable, affordable power supply for everyone,” he says. De Decker adds that, with the South African Revenue Service encouraging investment into renewable energy through significant tax incentives, funding for qualifying projects will be readily available, as investors seek out the significant tax breaks. Further, the development of the renewable energy sector, supported by government, has the potential to create more jobs while improving the South African economy, he says.
