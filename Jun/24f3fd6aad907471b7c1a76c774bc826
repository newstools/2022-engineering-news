JSE-listed chemicals manufacturing group Omnia expects to report a year-on-year increase of between 70% and 90% in headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the financial year ended March 31. HEPS are expected to be between R6.39 and R7.14, compared with the R3.76 posted in the prior financial year. Omnia says it has successfully been executing its refreshed operating model, which resulted in a resilient operating performance across the business. It adds that it has effectively mitigated many global disruptors, including supply chain issues, Covid-19, volatile input costs and extreme weather, through a strong focus on customer satisfaction, optimised supply chains and integrated manufacturing facilities. Omnia will communicate further about its full-year results and dividends on June 20.
