The Western Cape government has launched a new Web-enabled dashboard as part of efforts to reduce the red tape on small businesses that are interested in becoming suppliers to the province.

The new dashboard allows users to filter information they wish to access and interrogate it further. It will also enhance competition and the likelihood of participation by small, medium-sized and microenterprises, as they are now able to see all opportunities across departments for a particular commodity or service over the entire year.

The functionality of the new dashboard is expected to help suppliers to access and plan for future tender opportunities and prepare to participate in the procurement process. Western Cape Economic Opportunities Minister Mireille Wenger says the new dashboard will allow access to all departmental procurement plans for 2022/23, comprising about 4 000 tenders.
