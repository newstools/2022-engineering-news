Diversified mining and renewable energy solutions company Exxaro Resources, in partnership with energy company TotalEnergies South Africa, have donated over R930 000 to education programmes in Limpopo and Mpumalanga, supporting efforts to empower the local communities. Exxaro says it believes sustainable communities are created through proactive engagement, a deep understanding of societal needs and best practices. Moreover, it notes that the company recognises the importance of partnerships, as it allows for resource optimisation, enabling a broader reach in communities. “When our fuel supplier, TotalEnergies South Africa, donated funds for socioeconomic development initiatives, we identified projects that would positively impact our communities,” Exxaro says. Exxaro says that, in Lephalale, the lack of driver’s licences has impeded the youth from participating in employment opportunities. This is especially the case for those who qualify as artisans at the company’s Grootegeluk training centre, Grovos, and other technical institutions. Therefore, R500 000 was allocated to the driver’s licence training in Lephalale, prioritising these students. Exxaro adds that, over the past few years, education has been central to uplifting its communities. It has responded to the Nkangala district municipality's request to participate in its school shoe donation campaign. Exxaro donated 710 pairs of shoes to the schools where it operates, amounting to R516 000. Through the TotalEnergies South Africa contributions, Exxaro says its donation reached 710 primary school learners in the Victor Khanye, Emalahleni and Emakhazeni local municipalities.
