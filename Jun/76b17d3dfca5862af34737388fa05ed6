Black industrialist firm Dalisu Holdings believes it will make a notable contribution to South Africa’s gross domestic product (GDP) with its sulphate purifying factory, in Mkhondo, Mpumalanga.

Dalisu produces 99.5% purified sodium sulphate. Its target is to produce about 30 000 t/y of highly purified sodium sulphate for the local detergents and glass industries.

The entities' R254-million state-of-the-art manufacturing plant started commercial production in 2021 following the provision of financial support by the Industrial Development Corporation and the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition under its Black Industrialists Incentive Scheme.

“The bulk of the sodium sulphate that is used in [South Africa] is imported from China, India and Spain. And this provides us with a positive challenge to explore opportunities for expansion in order to increase local production and decrease the importing of the product,” says Dalisu co-executive director Mohlomi Mothobi.
