BTE Renewables has acquired Sonnedix Solar South Africa, increasing its pan-African renewables operating portfolio to 473 MW across six independent power producers in South Africa and Kenya. Through the transaction, BTE Renewables has secured a 60% interest in the 75 MW Mulilo Sonnedix Prieska solar photovoltaic (PV) facility, situated in the Northern Cape. The company will also take on the asset management of the facility, which entered into commercial operation in July 2016 and is in the same region as two of its other solar PV plants. The balance of the Prieska project’s shareholding is held by Mulilo Energy Holdings (20%), Ixowave (15%), which is an empowerment company, and the Prieska PV Community Trust (5%). “This acquisition clearly demonstrates our commitment to growing our renewable energy asset portfolio, as it is complementing our organic growth from our strong portfolio of development projects,” BTE Renewables CEO Robert Skjodt said in a statement. The company, which is wholly owned by Actis, also owns the 46 MW Aggeneys solar project, the 86 MW Konkoonsies II Solar facility, the 32.5 MW Excelsior wind farm and the 120 MW Golden Valley wind facility in South Africa, as well as the 102 MW Kipeto wind project, in Kenya.
