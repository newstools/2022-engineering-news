The KwaZulu-Natal government is committed to maintaining infrastructure and ensuring that people living in rural areas and suburbs receive the same standard of service delivery.

Premier Sihle Zikalala made the announcement in uMbhumbhulu, on June 6, as part of the launch of a R187-million investment that is aimed at upgrading and rehabilitating strategic roads connecting economic areas in the eThekwini metropolitan municipality. Over 340 job opportunities will be created during the road construction and local companies will be prioritised to participate in the construction of the roads. Zikalala said the project was part of the provincial government’s continued efforts to rebuild the transport infrastructure that was damaged by the floods in April.
