Trade union Solidarity has laid charges of fraud, corruption and violation of the Public Finance Management Act against former Eskom executives Brian Molefe, Anoj Singh and Matshela Koko, as well as former Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane. The union says justice has been delayed for too long and that South African citizens deserve immediate action from the South African Police Service (SAPS) and other structures. “The absolute injustice of years of corruption and theft cannot continue any further with an endless delay from our criminal justice system. These matters must continue. The pressure is now on our security services to do their job and the dragging of feet any further will not be tolerated,” says Solidarity CEO Dr Dirk Hermann. Solidarity argues that the damage caused by corruption is not limited to financial loss, but that it destroys the State’s ability to provide critical services and that it cultivates distrust among citizens towards the country’s legal system. “For South Africans to have hope and any confidence in the legal process, there must be consequences for people who illegally enrich themselves at the expense of the country’s prosperity and existence. If it is true that they are responsible for the fatal situation of our only power provider, they must be punished for every crime and abuse of power that is stipulated in the charges,” says Hermann. Solidarity also said that if no real progress is made with its charges, private prosecution would be an option in the future.
