Independent electricity brand Earth & Wire has signed a 12-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Energy Exchange of Southern Africa to provide 5 MW, or 13 GWh/y, of solar energy to Mediclinic and another large customer. The power will be generated from the Slimsun Too photovoltaic project, near Malmesbury, in the Western Cape, and delivered to the customers using power utility Eskom’s national grid. The generation facility and its three off-takers are all connected to the grid. Financial close is scheduled for the end of August and construction should begin soon after that. Commercial operation is expected to be achieved by April 2023. “These are the first Earth & Wire sales to multiple customers from one source using the Energy Exchange. “This heralds the beginning of a new era of private electricity agreements with consumers looking for cost-effective, reliable energy within a competitive open market,” commends Earth & Wire business development head Thomas Garner. “We are particularly thrilled that Mediclinic has signed with Energy Exchange. They are a ‘critical care’ business that cannot afford to operate in an insecure energy environment,” he adds. “Procuring renewable energy forms part of the Mediclinic strategy. We strongly believe that the use of renewable energy is important in ensuring a healthy planet for future generations. “We are also focused on reducing consumption by investing in energy efficient equipment and changing human behaviour, which also assists in mitigating rising electricity costs,” says Mediclinic Southern Africa infrastructure GM Kobus Jonck. Garner says the customer is happy with the tariff that has been agreed. “Important as this deal is, we are very excited about where we go next. We have around 1 500 MW of shovel-ready wind, solar and storage capacity,” he says.
