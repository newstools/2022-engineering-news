Western Cape Infrastructure Minister Tertuis Simmers this week turned the sod to mark the first phase of construction of the Deferred Ownership Project, in Cape Agulhas. The R55-million project is aimed at making affordable homes available for first-time home buyers residing in the Bredasdorp and the broader Cape Agulhas municipal area. It is further envisaged to create 106 affordable housing opportunities.

Simmers says the project will benefit Western Cape citizens who do not qualify for fully State-subsidised houses.
