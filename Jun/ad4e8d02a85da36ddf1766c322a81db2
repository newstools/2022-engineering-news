The South African Institute of Civil Engineering (Saice) launched an online platform for employment- and mentorship-seeking members, called Saice Connect, on June 1. The portal is aimed at assisting corporates with recruiting personnel for vacant positions and with finding Saice members employment and mentorship opportunities. It facilitates sharing of job seekers’ resumes and was founded as a response to members’ needs following the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on jobs and the job market. The portal will facilitate full-time, part-time and contract employment opportunities and is free to access and use for Saice members. Saice marketing head Nthabeleng Lentsoane says the portal is especially useful to find candidates most suited to specific job positions, as opposed to posting adverts for jobs to which people apply regardless of their qualifications. Saice Connect lists various categories of potential employment opportunities, such as for students seeking vacation work and post-varsity work, for unemployed members or those seeking a job change and for entrepreneurs and subcontractors. It also offers job openings for consultants and in government contracts, academia and State-owned entities, as well as options to join consortiums to secure work. Saice fellow Innocentia Mahlangu says an issue of concern to many in the civil engineering industry is rising unemployment, including the issue of unemployed graduates. “So, the launch of Saice Connect comes at an opportune time, when it is most needed in the South African industry.”
