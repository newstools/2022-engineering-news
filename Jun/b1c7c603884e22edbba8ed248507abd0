Mercedes-Benz South Africa (MBSA) will dispose of the passenger car business of its Gauteng West own-retail operations, as well as a portion of its commercial vehicle business, held in Sandown Motor Holdings (SMH), to the Motus Group. The value of the deal is not disclosed. SMH is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MBSA. The proposed disposal of SMH forms part of MBSA’s implementation of Project Focus, which resulted in the earlier spin-off of Daimler Truck from the Mercedes-Benz car business on a global level. The rationale for the spin-off was to enable Mercedes-Benz and Daimler Truck greater entrepreneurial flexibility and agility, the independence to focus on its strategic direction in respect to electric mobility transformation, improved customer centricity and the opportunity to unlock their full potential. “MBSA’s proposed sale of SMH is the next logical step in the growth of our company,” says Mercedes-Benz Cars and MBSA executive director Mark Raine. “A simplified corporate structure will enable MBSA to focus on the next phase of the company’s growth premised on customer centricity, and the . . . Mercedes-Benz, Mercedes-AMG, Mercedes-Maybach and Mercedes-EQ brands.” The proposed disposal will include the following dealerships: Mercedes-Benz Sandton, Mercedes-Benz Constantia Kloof, Mercedes-Benz Bryanston and a single commercial vehicle dealership in Roodepoort.
