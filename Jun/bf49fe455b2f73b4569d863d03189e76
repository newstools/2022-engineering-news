The 147 MW Karusa Wind Farm, in the Western Cape, has entered into commercial operation, raising Enel Green Power South Africa’s installed capacity to 1.2 GW across ten wind and solar projects. Located in a remote part of the Laingsburg local municipality, the €200-million wind farm incorporates Vestas V136-4.2MW wind turbines, which are reportedly the largest on the African continent to date. Awarded to Enel Green Power in 2016 as part of Bid Window Four of South Africa’s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme, construction of the wind farm began in 2019. It will generate more than 500 GWh yearly and sell the electricity to Eskom under a 20-year power purchase agreement. With Karusa Wind Farm operational, country manager Manuele Battisti reports that Enel Green Power South Africa has six wind farms up and running, including Nojoli (88 MW), Oyster Bay (148 MW), Nxuba (148 MW), Gibson Bay (111 MW) and Garob (145 MW), with its Soetwater (147 MW) wind farm expected to achieve commercial operation during July.
