South Africa cannot afford the massive and continued knock-on effects from disruptions to the national supply chain caused by truck driver blockades on the N3 to and from the Port of Durban, as was again seen last week, says the South African Association of Freight Forwarders (SAAFF) “International trade partners and investors need to see this nation come together to end this situation . . . . in an already fragile economy,” warns the association. “The situation has become untenable and is eroding the good efforts of government and the private sector to create employment and to fast-track reforms for economic growth aimed at facilitating trade expansion and restoring our economy to good health,” says SAAFF CEO Dr Juanita Maree. “This is where the smooth flow of our supply chain plays a critical role. “The blockages caused by unresolved labour and social conflict will cost South Africa dearly as a reputable international trade partner due to the loss of investor confidence,” she notes. “We are in a particularly delicate situation which requires strong leadership. High unemployment, rising inflation and an already uncertain trading environment due to global dynamics [require] unity. Consultative action by government and the private sector to implement solutions is our collective responsibility.” Maree says SAAFF strongly condemns the blockage on the N3 and any associated disruptions. “We add our voice to that of the Presidency, Business Unity South Africa and the Department of Transport, urgently calling for an end to the blockade of roads, for the sake of the future of our country.”
