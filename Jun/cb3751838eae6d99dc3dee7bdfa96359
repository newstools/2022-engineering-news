The Germany-based Power Systems business of UK-domiciled major international power and propulsion systems and technology group Rolls-Royce has taken another step towards achieving net-zero carbon operations, with the opening of a new solar power complex, or park, in southern Germany. The solar park, named Berghof, is located at Tengen, in the German State of Baden-Württemberg. The new solar power complex has a capacity of 3.7 MWp and will supply Rolls-Royce Power Systems with some 4 000 000 kW/h of electricity a year. This will cut 1 300 t of carbon dioxide emissions annually, compared with the conventionally-generated electricity available in Germany. The solar park has a design life of at least 25 years. Although Rolls-Royce is the power purchaser for the solar park, the facility is managed and predominantly (66%) owned by specialised company solarcomplex. The remaining 33% of the park is held by the owner of the land upon which it is built. “With our Net Zero at Power Systems programme, we are pursuing strict climate protection targets,” highlighted Rolls-Royce Power Systems chief technology officer and chief operating officer Dr Otto Preiss. “With ambitious interim targets for 2030, we aim to be completely climate neutral by 2050 across all global sites and areas from production to supply chains to our product portfolio.” “Throughout Germany, the expansion of renewable power generation must be accelerated, and Baden-Württemberg has a particularly high need to catch up,” affirmed solarcomplex CEO Bene Müller. “This can only succeed if more and larger projects are also implemented for ground-mounted solar parks. Our Berghof solar park shows how it can be done.”
