Budget brand Suzuki Auto South Africa has recorded a sales jump of 630 vehicles from April to May, to hit a new overall record of 4 331 new-car sales a month. This comes as cash-strapped South Africans continue to battle rising interest rates and fuel prices. The fresh record also means that Suzuki was South Africa’s favourite passenger vehicle brand in May, and that it is now firmly established as the third largest manufacturer on the industry sales roster. The Suzuki Swift was also South Africa’s best-selling vehicle in May, with sales of 1 764 units. To put the brand’s stellar rise into perspective, a year ago Suzuki was number five in the market (with Hyundai and Ford ahead of it), with sales of just over 2 000 units. “Since opening our doors in South Africa in 2008, we have spent a lot of time, energy and money on establishing a strong dealer network, a healthy head office team and a large parts warehouse that can deliver on our brand promise of value for money and great customer service,” says Suzuki Auto dealer sales manager Henno Havenga. “Now, with a network of 81 dealers, we are seeing the strong growth that a firmly established root system can deliver.” Havenga also congratulates Suzuki dealers for breaking through the 3 000-unit barrier in May, with total retail sales of 3 100 units. Most of the remaining Suzuki vehicles were moved through its government, rental and fleet sales division, which reported sales of 1 229 units. Suzuki will launch its newest model – the 2022 Suzuki Baleno – in June. “The Baleno sets a new standard for value for money,” says Suzuki Auto South Africa brand marketing manager Brendon Carpenter. “With luxuries such as climate control, an infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as top-model features such as head-up display and a round-view camera system, we hope to set a new standard for the compact hatchback market and welcome even more people to the Suzuki family.”
