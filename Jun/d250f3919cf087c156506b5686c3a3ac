Hospitality management company BON Hotels’ team has taken over the management of  the Queen’s Hotel, in Oudtshoorn, with BON Hotels CEO and founder Guy Stehlik calling this a “new and exciting chapter for the group”. “Established in 1880, and recently restored to her original beauty, the Queen’s Hotel is a grand dame of South African hoteliery. What’s exciting for BON is that she is a much-loved landmark in Oudtshoorn, itself an incredibly special town – the heart of the Klein Karoo and jewel of the Garden Route,” he acclaims. The Queen’s Hotel boasts 42 rooms complete with modern amenities. The hotel has two eateries, the Colony Restaurant and Café Brûlé. The Colony Restaurant offers South African fare, while Café Brûlé hosts an in-house bakery and semi-enclosed streetside setting. “The Queen’s Hotel combines old-world charm with warm, Karoo hospitality, and it already has an enviable, loyal customer base of international and domestic visitors. Of course, its rich history and position also make it a very exciting addition for BON. “There is much to do and explore for young and old alike in Oudtshoorn, and a stay at the Queen's Hotel will offer even more for visitors to the region. We look forward to a really successful partnership with the owners and Queen’s Hotel team,” Stehlik says. Currently, the BON Hotels portfolio includes hotels across South Africa, Swaziland, Nigeria, Ghana and Ethiopia. He says BON Hotels has taken over the administration, management and marketing of the Queen’s Hotel from June 1.
