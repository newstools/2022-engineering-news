Two Passenger Railway Agency of South Africa (PRASA) workers are in a critical condition after being shot and wounded while repairing cables on Cape Town's beleaguered Central Line. On Tuesday morning, police were called to the scene at the railway lines near Kalksteenfontein where the workers had been shot by unknown gunmen. According to police, the suspects arrived at the scene in a VW Polo and opened fire on the two. PRASA spokesperson Nana Zenani said details were still sketchy, but the preliminary report suggested the contractors were shot during the course of their work. "The incident took place along the Central Line while contractors were busy with recovery as part of the corridor recovery. The shooters intended to steal the copper cables before they were even relayed as part of the repair works," she added. Police are investigating cases of attempted murder. Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said a 44-year-old male was shot in both legs, while another, aged 36, was shot in his left arm. He also sustained bruises to the back of his head. "Both victims were taken to a nearby medical facility for medical treatment. According to reports, a  black Polo dropped two unknown males in Kalksteenfontein and the males approached the workers and started shooting at them,” Van Wyk added. "The motive surrounding the incident is unknown at this stage… The suspects fled the scene and are yet to be arrested." Anyone with more information on the shooting can contact Bishop Lavis detectives on 021 935 9820 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
