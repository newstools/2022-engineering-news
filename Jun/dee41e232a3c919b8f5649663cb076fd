The latest QS World University Rankings have boosted the University of Johannesburg’s (UJ’s) standing in South Africa and on the African continent. According to the latest figures, UJ now ranks second in South Africa and in Africa, climbing up one position. UJ Vice-Chancellor and Principal Professor Tshilidzi Marwala said the achievement was "tremendous" as UJ went up against 2 462 academic institutions. Globally, UJ ranks 412, up from 434 last year. It also ranked 94.3 in the International Research Network and 88.1 in the International Faculty Ratio category. The QS World University Rankings account for global academic and employer reputation, research output, quality of research, internationalisation, teaching and learning. “The latest global rankings reaffirm the fact that our academic programmes remain on par with international standards, as we continue with our mission to position UJ as the international university of choice, anchored in Africa and dynamically shaping the future. These rankings are a wonderful tribute to the sustained work by our staff and students as we continue to forge ahead and scale new heights,” Marwala said.
