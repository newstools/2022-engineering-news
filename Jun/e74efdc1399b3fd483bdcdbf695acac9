Volkswagen Group South Africa (VWSA) says production of the Polo and Polo Vivo at its Kariega plant in the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality is continuing, despite the water supply crisis in the area. “Our Kariega plant is operating as normal and there are no issues as yet with the water supply,” says a spokesperson for the local arm of the German car maker. VWSA notes that it has worked hard to reduce its water consumption over the last few years. “Our plant has reduced its water consumption by 19.4% if one compares 2021 versus 2019, and by 63% for 2021 versus 2010. “We have also introduced water recycling and rainwater harvesting in various areas of the plant.” VWSA adds that its component suppliers, spread across the Nelson Mandela Bay metro, have contingency plans in place to mitigate the impact of water supply disruptions on their businesses and, subsequently, their supply of parts to the Volkswagen plant. However, the manufacturer notes that some of its employees in “high-risk areas” have been affected by disruptions to the water supply. VWSA does not believe that the water-supply problems will affect its production figures for the year, and that customers here and abroad can expect their vehicles on time and as ordered. VWSA also notes that it is actively supporting initiatives by the Nelson Mandela Bay Business Chamber, such as Adopt-a-school and Adopt-a-leak, to rein in water leaks, and to ensure that local schools have access to clean water.
