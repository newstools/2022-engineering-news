Eskom will implement Stage 2 load-shedding every evening between 17:00 and 22:00, from Monday to Thursday. The power utility said the load shedding was due to the continued shortage of generation capacity. "Eskom will continue to closely monitor the system, adjust and communicate any changes as may be necessary. We appeal to all South Africans to help limit the impact of the shortages by continuing to reduce the usage of electricity and to switch off all non-essential items," said Eskom in a statement. The power utility currently has 5 232 MW on planned maintenance, while another 14 202 MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns.
