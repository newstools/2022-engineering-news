Daimler Trucks & Buses Southern Africa has been renamed Daimler Truck Southern Africa (DTSA). This follows the global unbundling of the German Daimler group into Daimler Truck and the Mercedes-Benz Group on December 1. DTSA is now a completely independent company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Daimler Truck, the world’s biggest truck and bus manufacturer. Addressing the change in its corporate structure, the Southern African entity says it has already “made notable strides” with the expansion of its corporate structure by founding its own captive financial mobility services, Daimler Truck Financial Services South Africa (DTFS). This is now followed by the change in name. “I can confirm that the renaming to DTSA is a natural move that is of paramount significance to us, as it reinforces our alignment to the group’s overall global structure and positioning,” says DTSA president and CEO Michael Dietz. “I would like to assure both our internal and external stakeholders that our business activities will remain unchanged and we will continue to deliver a full line range of accustomed game-changing trucks, buses and value-added services, without any compromise. “We are privileged and honoured to have exceptionally served the Southern Africa region for over 60 years and today we stand collectively as a team, equally driven, motivated and committed to further pursue our purpose for all who keep Africa moving, as we embark on the next 60 years.” He says the company continues to focus on the Mercedes-Benz Trucks, Mercedes-Benz Buses, and Fuso Trucks brands. This also includes providing parts and services for Freightliner and Western Star trucks for the entire Southern Africa region, including South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Zambia.
