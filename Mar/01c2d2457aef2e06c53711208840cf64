The Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE) says it is "extremely proud" of the ice-breaker SA Agulhas II's key role in the Endurance 22 expedition, which resulted in the discovery of the Endurance – the wreck of Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship – east of the Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea on March 5. The Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust had chartered the SA Agulhas II for the expedition, with the aim of locating, surveying and filming the wreck of the Endurance, which sank during the Antarctic expedition by Sir Shackleton in 1915. “We are proud of the role South Africa, through the SA Agulhas II, has played in the success of this expedition. It is a success that can be attributed to the excellent cooperation between the DFFE, the expedition leaders and the DFFE's ship management company – Amsol,” comments Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment Minister Barbara Creecy. The SA Agulhas II is one of the most advanced and modern polar research vessels in the world and is used by the DFFE for yearly science and logistics expeditions into the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. The ship is a shared science platform with the Department of Science and Innovation. The vessel was chartered to perform a similar voyage in 2019, but the first search for the Endurance was unsuccessful. In addition to locating and surveying the wreckage of the Endurance, the expedition team comprising world-leading glaciologists, marine biologists, oceanographers and marine archaeologists, also ventured into remote regions of the Weddell Sea with the hope of uncovering vital new scientific data to improve our understanding of the area. The information collected and knowledge gained will contribute to the further protection of the region.
