Online car trade company WeBuyCars officially opened the WeBuyCars The Dome on March 24 – the biggest showroom in the group’s portfolio, capable of accommodating more than 1 300 vehicles. The opening of the landmark property is a momentous occasion in the company’s history and marks significant growth in recent years, testament to which is the 11 000 cars traded in the last month - a record number, the company says. The last time WeBuyCars held a showroom opening event was just over two years ago at the opening of the Brackenfell facility in Cape Town, says WeBuyCars CEO Faan van der Walt. “Since then, Covid-19 has disrupted our lives in ways most of us could never have imagined. Many of us lost loved ones. If that wasn’t enough, the civil unrest that rocked the country in July 2021 has left deep economic and social scars across the country. "As a company, we are grateful that WeBuyCars not only survived this period, but was able to grow during a time of great uncertainty,” he says. Despite Covid-19, and in addition to The Dome opening, WeBuyCars has opened five new showrooms in the past two years in Germiston, Montague Gardens, Gqeberha, Durban and Polokwane, with a showroom in Mbombela scheduled to open in April. Van der Walt paid tribute to the company's 2 000 staff, many of whom joined WeBuyCars at a junior level and worked their way up to managerial level, and who shaped the growth and direction of the company. "WeBuyCars will continue to innovate and enhance customer and user experience, while remaining true to the entrepreneurial spirit which has forged the company’s direction for the past two decades," he adds.
