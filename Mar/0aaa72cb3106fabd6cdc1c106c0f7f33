Angolan State-owned oil and gas company Sonangol's Research and Development Centre is working to develop a strategy to produce green hydrogen. It has been conducting conceptual and engineering studies in Angola to identify a site for the installation of a plant to produce green hydrogen and its derivatives for domestic and foreign consumption. The initiative is part of the company's energy transition strategy in the search for renewable energy resources developed in partnership with German companies Conjuncta and Gauff & Co and Engineering Kg, which signed an agreement to establish a factory to produce green hydrogen in Angola. Green hydrogen constitutes one of the cleanest energy sources. Owing to its geographic characteristics, hipsometric and abundant water resources, Angola stands out as a country with high potential in renewable energy sources, Sonangol states. Sonangol, through this and similar measures, reaffirms, once again, its commitment to the energy transition through the implementation of local solutions to produce alternative energy sources that preserve the environment, the company says.
