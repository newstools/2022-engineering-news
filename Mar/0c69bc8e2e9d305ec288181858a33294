Renowned French aerospace group Dassault Aviation released its performance and financial results for 2021 on Friday. It reported a consolidated net income of €605-million last year, an almost exactly 100% increase over the €303-million recorded in 2020. Consolidated operating income in 2021 was €545-million, as against €246-million during the previous year. The company achieved a consolidated net margin of 8.4% last year, up from the 5.5% reported in 2020. Adjusted net sales came to €7 233-million, up from €5 489-million in 2020. As of December 31 last year, the group possessed available cash totalling €4 879-million, a €1 438-million increase over the number recorded a year before. Also as of December 31, 2021, Dassault’s order backlog was worth €20 762-million, whereas on the same date in 2020 it had been worth €15 895-million. In terms of products, on the defence side the group delivered 25 of its Rafale ‘omnirole’ fighters, all to export customers (namely India and Qatar). The company also continued its development work on the F4 standard for the Rafale. It continued its work under Phase 1A of the Future Combat Air System last year, and will complete it during the first half of this year. Contracts for Phase 1B have not yet been awarded, because Dassault and Airbus Defence and Space have not yet been able to agree on their terms. Dassault also received support contracts from the French armed forces last year. On the civil side, it delivered 30 of its Falcon family of business jets (including at least one ‘special mission’ version, this being the sixth Falcon 2000 for the Japan Coast Guard). The group’s market guidance had been for the delivery of 25. Regarding special mission (for military and paramilitary missions) versions of its Falcon types, the company continued to develop the ‘Albatros’ maritime surveillance and response version of its Falcon 2000XLS, as well as the ‘Archange’ electronic warfare version of its Falcon 8X. The company also announced the first flight of its Falcon 6X and launched its Falcon 10X programme last year. “For Dassault Aviation, 2021 was a good year for both civil aviation and military sectors, with an exceptional order intake of 100 aircraft (49 Rafale and 51 Falcon),” highlighted group CEO Éric Trappier. The Rafale orders comprised 30 + 1 for Egypt, 12 for France and six for Greece. In addition, Greece bought 12 second-hand Rafales, as did Croatia. At the end of last year the total order backlog for new-build Rafales stood at 86, of which 40 were for France and 46 for export. This number excluded the 80 ordered by the United Arab Emirates, as that contract was awaiting final approval, and the order for 42 Rafales from Indonesia, which was awarded last month. These orders would be included in the figures for 2022.
