Former statesman Nelson Mandela’s original warrant of arrest has been digitally minted as a non-fungible token (NFT) and sold for R1.9-million. The proceeds are expected to save the Liliesleaf Farm and Museum. The NFT of the 1961 Warrant of Arrest for Nelson Mandela was specially minted 61 years after it was first issued. One of South Africa’s foremost national heritage sites, Liliesleaf Farm and Museum was recently forced to close its doors indefinitely following a funding crisis. Momint CEO Ahren Posthumus said Saturday’s event was a remarkable outcome for Liliesleaf, adding that the success of the event demonstrated the potential of the rise of blockchain technology to open a gateway to global markets for South Africa’s arts and culture industries. Momint is an Africa-based company that provides a social marketplace for NFTs and its decentralised app creates a digital marketplace for creators, curators and buyers. “Momint is committed to making the NFT space more inclusive for South Africans. Minting an NFT on Momint is free. This is just one of the ways that Momint is driving value, accessibility and utility. Through this platform, artists can release their work globally, build a following, and earn royalties in perpetuity,” Posthumus explained. He said the success of the event, just four months after Momint first hosted Africa’s largest NFT auction in November 2021, demonstrated the appetite and enthusiasm for South African digital art and artefacts. The highest bid of the night was for a Bored Ape token which sold for R4.2-million rand. A second Bored Ape token was sold for R1-million. Nine art pieces sold for between R55 000 and R250 000, while a token minted to raise funds for South African NPO Fight Back SA sold for R90 000, exceeding the reserve price.
