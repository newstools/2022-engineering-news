Property development company Investec Property will build a 5.25 MW rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) plant at the Cornubia Mall, in Durban, to reduce the mall's reliance on the grid and ease the pressure on the national power grid. This is a key step in Investec Property’s mission to embrace renewable low-carbon emission technology across its assets, thereby decreasing their environmental impact on society. Energy engineering company Terra Firma Solutions will install the plant, which Investec Property says is one of the fifteenth biggest rooftop solar plants in the world, over the next five months. “We are incredibly proud of our team for securing this deal and for being able to enhance the value of the exceptional shopping centre Cornubia Mall. We will have 18 MW of solar power across the group when we have completed our project at Cornubia by mid-April,” Investec Property co-CEO Gavin Bernstein says. The plant will have a 5.25 MW direct current capacity and 4.29 MW alternating current capacity.
