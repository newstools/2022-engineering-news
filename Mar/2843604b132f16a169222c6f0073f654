The Western Cape government has launched the R10-million Municipal Ease of Doing Business Fund, which will provide capacity and funding support to municipalities to make it easier for companies to do business in the Western Cape. The fund is expected to support at least seven to ten municipalities in improving their institutional capacity to improve the business enabling environment. The objectives of the fund are, among others, to alleviate the administrative and other associated burdens of doing business. Western Cape Finance and Economic Opportunities Minister David Maynier says the province has prioritised making it easier to do business. The fund will, therefore, support municipal interventions to reduce the regulatory burden, improve business processes and ensure effective communication with businesses, with the overall outcome being an improved environment in which businesses operate. This fund will also improve the overall performance of municipal services and processes related to business-facing services, such as permitting. It will further support both district and local municipalities to institutionalise ease of doing business and become well-functioning institutions, which deliver quality and efficient services.
