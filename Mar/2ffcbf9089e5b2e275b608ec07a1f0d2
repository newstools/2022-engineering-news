Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has expressed concern about the impact of the grounding of Comair's aircraft on the country's tourism sector. The South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) at the weekend suspended Comair's Air Operation Certificate following safety-related incidents. The grounding has left thousands of passengers stranded. Comair flights account for about 40% of the country’s aviation capacity. Sisulu on March 15 said this came at a bad time, as families were preparing for school holidays and holidaymakers were planning Easter holiday getaways. "However, our main concern is the effect this will have on greater tourism and the entire hospitality value chain, but not at the expense of air travel safety,” she said. Sisulu also raised concern about the increase in air fares on domestic routes as a result of the grounding of Comair's aircraft. “I would like the issues between Comair and the SACAA to be resolved soon, as the tourism industry cannot afford any further discouragements,” she said.
