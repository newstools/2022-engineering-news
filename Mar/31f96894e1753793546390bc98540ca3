Chris de Kock will hand over the leadership of WesBank to Ghana Msibi at end of June as he retires after nearly 35 years at the finance group. Msibi is the current CEO of WesBank’s motor retail division. De Kock joined WesBank in 1987 and has held the role of CEO since September, 2013. He says it is time to hand over the reins to the next generation of leadership. “I am very proud of the business we have collectively built over the years. “WesBank is a market leader in vehicle and asset finance with an unparalleled portfolio of partnerships. “Our unique model has allowed us to deliver a long track record of growth and returns to the shareholders of WesBank’s parent FirstRand Limited. “I am pleased that Ghana has agreed to take on this role and I have every confidence that he will make it a great success.” Msibi, who has been with WesBank for the last seven years, says he is excited to lead WesBank. “It’s a very special business, with passionate people and high-quality, long-standing partnerships. It’s a privilege to take over from Chris.” De Kock will retire on June 30, but will remain with the FirstRand group for the next twelve months to ensure a seamless handover, and to finalise a number of strategic projects currently underway.
