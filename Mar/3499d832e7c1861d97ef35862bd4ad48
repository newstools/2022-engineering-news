African law firm Bowmans has appointed construction specialist Bavesh Pillay as a partner in its Johannesburg-based construction practice with effect from March 1. Pillay has specialist knowledge of the intricacies of complex construction and professional services contracts and has a sound understanding of the legislative and regulatory frameworks for construction procurement. He also has a strong commercial background and significant project finance knowledge, including of funding instruments such as bonds, facility agreements and direct agreements. "We are delighted that Bavesh has come back to Bowmans. He is skilled in areas that are critical for growth and development across the continent. His considerable experience in sub-Saharan Africa will supplement our already strong construction team and be an excellent asset to our clients," says Bowmans chairperson and senior partner Ezra Davids. Pillay began his career as a candidate attorney at Bowmans and spent eight years moving up the ranks to the position of senior associate before leaving in 2016. He has led or worked on projects in a range of sectors, including energy, infrastructure, transport and commercial property. Many of these projects have been run in African jurisdictions outside of South Africa, notably Ghana, Liberia, Mozambique, Nigeria and Uganda. Examples include a new data centre in Lagos, Nigeria, a major mall development in Kampala, Uganda, a road construction development in Liberia and a hotel development in Accra, Ghana. Pillay has an LLB, awarded cum laude, by the University of KwaZulu-Natal, and an LLM from Harvard University’s Law School.
