Volvo Car South Africa (SA) says its local range of vehicles is now almost entirely electrified as the Swedish premium brand moves a step closer to its global ambition of transforming into a fully electric car company by 2030. The updated South African line-up now comprises predominantly all-electric, plug-in hybrid and mild-hybrid options. Volvo Car SA MD Greg Maruszewski says the move is in line with the Gothenburg-based company’s global strategy, and affords South African motorists the opportunity to experience the various benefits of the three stages of vehicle electrification. “Our mild-hybrid vehicles boast reduced tailpipe emissions, improved fuel economy and stronger on-road performance, making them ideal stepping stones to our plug-in hybrids, which add the major advantage of a pure-electric driving mode, and then, ultimately, our all-electric offering. “In short, our completely renewed line-up covers all of the electrification bases.” According to Maruszewski, Volvo Car SA’s decision to shift its primary focus to hybrid vehicles is based on the belief that this type of powertrain currently represents the ideal solution for the majority of the company’s local customers. With the S90 and V90 Cross Country line-ups now also featuring exclusively mild-hybrid powertrains, the only purely petrol-powered options that remain in Volvo’s local range are the T-badged derivatives in the XC40 line-up. In global terms, Volvo’s electrified line-up continues growing, with plug-in hybrids accounting for 28% of sales in the fourth quarter of last year, while fully electric cars made up 6% of total sales.
