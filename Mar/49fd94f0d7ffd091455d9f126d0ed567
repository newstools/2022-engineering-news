Renewable energy company Scatec has promoted project development executive VP Terje Pilskog to CEO, effective May 1, when incumbent Raymond Carlsen will step down after a 13-year tenure. “Pilskog has been instrumental in the strategic development of Scatec and has first-hand experience with both the commercial and operational aspects of the company. We are confident he is the right man to continue the development of Scatec as a . . . provider of renewable energy solutions globally,” said Scatec chairperson John Andersen Jr on March 28. He said Pilskog had nearly 20 years of experience in the renewable energy sector, possessing deep industry insight, and that he was well respected by the company’s business partners. Pilskog joined Scatec in 2013. Previously, he held various management positions within solar power company Renewable Energy Corporation. Prior to that he was an associate principal at management consulting firm McKinsey & Co. Scatec currently has more than 3.5 GW of renewable energy in operation and has set a target to reach 15 GW either in operation or under construction by the end of 2025, equivalent to NKr100-billion in gross capital expenditures. “We have a strong and competent organisation, a unique business model and a sound strategy for growth and value creation for the years to come. The green energy transition offers attractive growth opportunities for Scatec and my job will be to enable Scatec to deliver on the opportunities these create,” said Pilskog. Carlsen commented that Pilskog’s expertise would ensure a solid future for the company. Carlsen would remain one of the largest shareholders in Scatec but would now pursue other interests. “Raymond Carlsen has been a driving force behind the development of Scatec from a small niche player in solar power into the well-recognised provider of renewable energy solutions it is today,” Andersen concluded.
