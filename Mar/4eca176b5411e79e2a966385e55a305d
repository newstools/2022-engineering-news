Power utility Eskom will implement Stage 2 load-shedding from 17:00 on Monday to 05:00 on Wednesday morning, as Medupi Unit 3 had also broken down. Earlier, Eskom announced load-shedding would begin at 21:00 on Monday. Eskom said this was owing to the failure of a number of generating units over the past 24 hours. A unit each at the Matla, Kendal, Matimba, Kusile and Grootvlei power stations had tripped since Monday morning. This was in addition to other units that had tripped over the weekend. Load-shedding is required to replenish the emergency generation reserves, which have been used significantly since the weekend.
