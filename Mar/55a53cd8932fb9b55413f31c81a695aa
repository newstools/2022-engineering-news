Jonathan Weltman has resigned as CFO of JSE-listed Balwin and as an executive director with effect from March 31, owing to health reasons. Balwin has appointed Jonathan Bigham as CFO and executive director, in line with the company’s succession planning, with effect from April 1. Bigham has also been appointed as a member of the social, ethics and transformation committee with effect from April 1. In a statement, Balwin expressed its appreciation to Weltman for his outstanding contribution, leadership, commitment and service to Balwin over the past decade and wished him everything of the best going forward. Weltman was appointed as financial manager at Balwin in 2012 where he is noted to have played an instrumental role in formalising the group’s financial function and implementing systems and controls to support the growth and expansion of the business. He was subsequently appointed as an executive director in 2014, after which he spearheaded Balwin’s listing on the JSE in 2015. “It is with gratitude and sadness that I’m stepping down from Balwin. I am, however, immensely proud of what we have achieved over the past decade, joining Mr Brookes and the team and successfully listing Balwin on the JSE, growing the company into an international award-winning and largest sectional title developer in South Africa,” comments Weltman. Weltman will consult to Balwin as part of the handover period. Meanwhile, Bigham holds a BCom (Hons) and CA (SA) qualification and is a member of Balwin’s executive committee. He joined Balwin in 2018 as the group finance manager and has worked very closely with Weltman on the finance and administration functions of the group, including cash and capital management, funding and capital raising, risk management, as well as regulatory and governance matters.
