Tiger Wheel & Tyre has unveiled the company’s first solar-powered store. The automotive parts and fitment brand’s Fourways store, in Johannesburg, is the first of the family to complete the move to solar power. The system was installed by Easy Power. Tiger Wheel & Tyre plans to have all of its stores run on solar energy within the next three years. The company says there are various reasons for the move to renewable energy, including a responsibility to ensure a healthier future for generations to come, soaring energy prices, and the uncertainty around load-shedding. “Society, and that includes us, our shareholders and financiers, have a duty to take active steps towards using clean renewable energy sources to lessen our impact upon the environment,” says TiAuto Investments CEO Alex Taplin. “State-of-the-art technology that embraces sustainability is now readily available, so it would be highly remiss of us were we not to incorporate these technologies and obvious benefits into our everyday operations. “The advantages of solar power are tangible and measurable,” says Taplin. “By way of example, if we take just the initial Fourways store pilot project, we’re looking at a reduction of over 28 000 kg of reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions a year. That’s the equivalent of 64 trees saved. “Once we have fully executed the stores in Phase 1 to solar power, representing 16 stores, we will be reducing emissions equivalent by over 560 000 kg of CO2, as well as reducing our oil equivalent by 80 000 litres a year. That’s the same as saving 1 200 trees a year.” Tiger Wheel & Tyre’s solar solution enables stores to continue at full operation and at normal capacity, without any reduction in the product or service offerings available to customers.
