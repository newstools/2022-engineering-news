Transnet is investigating the cause of a fire that broke out in a shipping container at its Durban Container Terminal Pier 2, on the morning of March 7. The cause of the fire is yet to be determined, but has been contained with impacted containers being moved to an isolated stacking area so that their owners can offload them as soon as possible. This follows another fire from a container of the same consignment on March 5. Transnet notes that each consignment entering its ports is required to be declared in terms of the International Maritime Dangerous Good (IMDG) codes. In this regard, Transnet has contacted the responsible shipping agent to establish what was in the container. Goods are declared in terms of the IMDG as either general or dangerous goods. Transnet is also in contact with Customs and other relevant authorities on the matter.
