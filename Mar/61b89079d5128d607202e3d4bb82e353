Cabinet has approved the National Infrastructure Plan (NIP) 2050 for implementation, as well as the publication of the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Rollout Strategy of 2022 in the Government Gazette for public comment. The NIP contains catalytic projects that are meant to contribute towards the country’s long-term economic and social developmental goals. The plan received a number of written comments after it was published for public comment in August 2021. Inputs were also received from public consultations with various stakeholders in the infrastructure sector. The consultation also included regional and continental bodies such as the Southern African Development Community and African Union Commission for Infrastructure. The NIP provides for the development of the country’s infrastructure networks that are aligned to the National Spatial Development Framework and the District Development Model. It also focuses on the construction of infrastructure that will advance socioeconomic development, and also generate employment and broad-based black economic empowerment opportunities. Meanwhile, the LPG Rollout Strategy seeks to contribute towards addressing the country’s energy supply challenges. The strategy deals with the structural features of the current LPG market, existing infrastructure, the pricing structure and the current local manufacturing capacity of LPG cylinders. It also touches on safety and awareness to raise the profile of domestic gas as an environment-friendly fuel.
