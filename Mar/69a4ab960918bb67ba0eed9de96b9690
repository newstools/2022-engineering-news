South African private sector regional airline Airlink has announced that it is to inaugurate a new service, linking two of South Africa’s coastal cities. The route will be operated every day except Saturdays and will provide a direct link between Durban and Gqeberha (previously, and better known as, Port Elizabeth). Airlink already operates services between Gqeberha and Johannesburg and Gqeberha and Cape Town. The new route, of course, also increases the number of destinations that the airline serves from Durban. Already, the carrier flies from Durban to Johannesburg, Mbombela (Nelspruit) and Harare in Zimbabwe. The new service will start functioning on April 4, but tickets are already available. The route will be operated by the airline’s Embraer regional jets. “By offering a direct service between the two coastal cities, which are also important industrial, tourism and trade nodes, Airlink is introducing competition and giving travellers more options,” affirmed airline CEO and MD Rodger Foster. “This latest expansion of our comprehensive route network will promote economic activity between the two metropoles and their market catchment areas. These cover the KwaZulu-Natal north and south coasts as well as Eastern Cape cities and towns such as Coega, Kariega (Uitenhage), Makanda (Grahamstown) and popular tourist destinations such as Port Alfred, Jeffrey’s Bay, Cape St Francis and the Garden Route.” Two flights will be operated each way, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon. The first flight each day will operate from Durban to Gqeberha, departing at 06h15; its flight code will be 4Z520. The return flight from Gqeberha will be coded 4Z521 and depart at 08h15. The afternoon flight from Durban will be coded 4Z528 and leave at 16h10, with the return flight from Gqeberha carrying the code 4Z529 and departing at 18h25. Flight time each way will be about 90 minutes.
