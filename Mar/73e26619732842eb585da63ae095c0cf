Air Seychelles, the State-owned national flag carrier for the Indian Ocean archipelagic country, released its operational report for 2021 on Friday. Operating a fleet of two Airbus A320neo single-aisle jets and five Viking Air DHC-6-400 Twin Otter 19-seater twin-engined turboprop aircraft, last year was “filled with agility and resilience” stated the airline. The two A320neos carried a total of 16 121 passengers on chartered repatriation flights around the world. In the process, they flew to 20 destinations never before served by Air Seychelles, spread across Africa, Asia, Australasia and Europe. In Africa, first-time destinations included Angola (Luanda), Botswana, Mayotte and Togo (Lomé). In Asia, they included Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and Manila in the Philippines, while in Australasia they were Perth and Sydney. New destinations served also included Bucharest in Romania. The easing of travel restrictions around the world also saw an increase in scheduled passenger traffic, compared with 2020. The carrier flew 350 regional and 5 529 domestic flights last year, carrying 95 458 passengers. Domestically, the peak travel month in 2021 was October, with 11 967 passengers carried between Mahe and Praslin. Regionally, Israel was the most popular destination, with travel on that route peaking at 2 473 in September. Air cargo demand (both imports and exports) in 2021 was 12.75% up on the figure for 2020. In number terms, air cargo carried by Air Seychelles came to 7 578.07 t in 2021, in comparison to 7 460.26 t in 2020. “2021 was definitely a year filled with challenges,” observed airline acting CEO Sandy Benoiton. “Despite the uncertainties in the market, I am happy that the Air Seychelles team remained determined, showcased great agility and resilience by adapting to the changes within the operating environment at a fast pace, doing their best to keep Air Seychelles flying.”
