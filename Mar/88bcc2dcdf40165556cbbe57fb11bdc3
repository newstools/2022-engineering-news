Last year almost 40% of all new Porsche vehicles delivered in Europe were either plug-in hybrids or fully electric models. “In 2025, half of all new Porsche sales are expected to come from the sale of electric vehicles – in other words, all-electric or plug-in hybrid," says Porsche chairperson Oliver Blume. "In 2030, the share of all new vehicles with an all-electric drive should be more than 80%." To achieve these ambitious goals, Porsche is investing in joint charging stations, as well in its own charging infrastructure. Investments are also flowing into core technologies such as battery systems and module production. In the newly founded Cellforce Group, high-performance battery cells are being developed and produced with the expectation that they should be ready for series production by 2024. Porsche has also announced its intention to be carbon-neutral by 2030. In the past financial year, the Stuttgart-based sports car manufacturer reached a new record in both sales revenue and operating profit. Sales reached €33.1-billion ­­– €4.4 billion more than in the previous year. Operating profit reached €5.3-billion, exceeding the previous year's figure by €1.1-billion. Porsche last year delivered 301 915 vehicles to customers worldwide, exceeding the 300 000 mark for the first time in history. The bestselling models were the Macan (88 362 units) and the Cayenne (83 071 units). Delivery figures for the Taycan more than doubled, with 41 296 customers taking delivery of the first all-electric Porsche. This means the Taycan sold more than the iconic 911, although the latter also set a new record at 38 464 units. “We are stepping up our electric offensive with another model. By the middle of the decade we want to offer our mid-engine 718 sports car exclusively in an all-electric form,” says Blume.
