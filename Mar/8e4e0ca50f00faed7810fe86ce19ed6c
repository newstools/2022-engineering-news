Financial services provider Nedbank Group has announced that it will list on the A2X Markets stock exchange, effective April 1. This listing complements the financial institution’s main listing on the JSE and a secondary listing on the Namibian Stock Exchange. Nedbank CFO Mike Davis says the A2X listing provides investors optionality to trade on their stock exchange of choice and potentially save costs when trading in Nedbank shares. A2X now has 62 instruments available for trade, with a combined market capitalisation of about R4.2-trillion. Nedbank joins other banking companies Investec and Standard Bank on A2X.
