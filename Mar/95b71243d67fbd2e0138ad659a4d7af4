The Sasol Solar Challenge (SSC) is set to return from September 9 to 16 this year. “It should come as no surprise that the 2022 challenge is one that is highly anticipated,” says SCC director and owner Robert Walker. “It’s great to see just how much this event continues to evolve with the help of so many communities, businesses, volunteers, partners and sponsors.” The 2022 SSC – the seventh biennial solar-car race – will move across more than 20 different towns and through five provinces. For this year, the eight-day challenge has an almost brand-new route. “We are expanding the reach of the event across the country to not only showcase the mind-blowing innovations and technologies developed by the teams, but also raise awareness on the use of renewable energy to save our country and the entire planet,” notes Walker. “The SSC goal is to impact communities to develop and embrace renewable energy and the future of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). “One of the key objectives for the SSC is to attract young people to STEM-based studies, through hands-on learning and real-life applications from like-minded scholars from around the world, who will be racing through their towns.” "The Sasol Solar Challenge demonstrates the value of STEM initiatives,” adds Sasol group brand and sponsorships senior manager Nozipho Mbatha. “It is a showcase of where engineering and technology meet in real life.” The SSC is a biennial competition that sees local and international solar-powered vehicles challenge each other to race as far as possible along a set route, using only the power of the sun. The event runs on public roads, sharing space with trucks and regular traffic. “It’s always been a fundamental challenge to see who can notch up the most kilometres down to Cape Town,” says Walker.
