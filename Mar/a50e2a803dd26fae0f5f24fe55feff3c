JSE-listed engineering and contracting group Murray & Roberts (M&R) has announced that a consortium of which its subsidiary Clough is a member, has been selected as the preferred bidder to develop a section of the Inland Rail project, in Queensland. The Regionerate Rail consortium comprises Clough, the Plenary Group, GS Engineering and Construction, Webuild and Service Steam. The awarded Gowrie to Kagaru section of the rail project has a contract value of more than A$5-billion for design and construction, of which about A$1.5-billion is attributable to Clough. The Inland Rail project is poised to transform how goods are moved around Australia and complete the backbone of the country’s national freight network. The Gowrie to Kagaru section of the project comprises 128 km of new and upgraded rail track and includes a 6.2-km-long tunnel, which M&R says will be the largest diameter freight tunnel in the southern hemisphere. M&R says the project adds to the order book of the group’s Energy, Resources and Infrastructure business platform, which trades under the Clough brand. The contract also secures a revenue base for the platform for the medium to long term.
