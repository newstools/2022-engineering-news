The construction of the Tulbagh Bulk Water Supply project is progressing well, with Phase 1 of the project, entailing the construction of a dam, 40% complete. The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) Western Cape provincial head Ntombizanele Bila-Mupariwa, observing the progress on the Tulbagh Bulk Water Supply construction site, said that the department was happy with the progress made on the construction site. “As of today, Phase 1 progress is at 40%, which is great. The project is on time, on budget and approved specification,” she said, further commending the teams involved in the construction, which includes Witzenberg local municipality officials, DWS officials and the developer. The Tulbagh Bulk Water Supply is intended to augment water supply for Witzenberg local municipality and was funded through DWS' Regional Bulk Infrastructure Grant. Upon completion, the dam will yield 1.2 megalitres of water. The last phase of the project, which involves the construction of the rising main and pump station, is scheduled for completion in June 2023. The project is creating much-needed jobs during the construction phase, creating the desired socioeconomic benefits. Once the project is fully completed, it will enable the development of low-cost housing development while improving water security within the region. During the 2004/5 drought period, the Witzenberg local municipality experienced serious water challenges, specifically in the town of Tulbagh. “Climate change has made us aware that these occurrences are seasonal, so we must explore other alternate water sources, such as recycled water and groundwater. By doing so, we can reduce heavy reliance on surface water,” concluded Bila-Mupariwa.
