State-owned power utility Eskom and industry organisation the South African Institute of Electrical Engineers (SAIEE) on March 8 celebrated International Women's Day under the theme of 'Gender equality for a sustainable tomorrow' and within the Eskom Women Advancement Programme (EWAP). Eskom CFO Calib Cassim, speaking at the Eskom Academy of Learning, in Midrand, said leadership had to be accountable for women's rights and gender equality, as women were leading the charge towards a more sustainable future, including climate change response efforts. He highlighted that International Women's Day was a clarion call to accelerate gender parity and raise awareness about women's equality. “The EWAP was launched in 2013 and takes a holistic approach to improving women's rights and roles in the company. Inequality stems from negative clichéd perceptions of women, which perpetuate the under-representation of women in leadership and technical roles. “The EWAP aims to address the obstacles that hinder women from advancing into critical leadership and technical positions in the business. "The objective of the programme is to achieve representativity of men and women in the Eskom workplace by actively pursuing women’s interests in the focus areas of women in leadership, women in nuclear, women in technical roles, creating an environment conducive to advancing women, as well as establishing and maintaining partnerships that support the EWAP goals to develop women into global leaders,” said Cassim.
