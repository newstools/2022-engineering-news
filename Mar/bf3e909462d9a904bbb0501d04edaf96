State logistics agency Transnet's board of directors has approved an addendum to its supply chain management policy to allow Transnet to include specific provisions for preferential procurement in its procurement processes, effective from March 25. The board resolved to continue applying the 80:20 and 90:10 preference point system provided for in the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act to promote preferential procurement in its processes, demonstrating the company’s continued commitment to transformation and empowerment. "The board has determined monetary thresholds for the application of the 80:20 and 90:10 preference point systems that will continue to provide certainty to bidders and Transnet’s procurement processes until new preferential procurement regulations are promulgated or the Constitutional Court judgment is clarified," Transnet said in a March 31 media statement. "This approach aligns with the Constitutional Court ruling that the policies of organs of state should take charge of driving transformation and preference in procurement to give effect to section 217(2) of the Constitution," it averred.
