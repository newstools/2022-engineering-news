Power utility Eskom said on Tuesday it will continue power cuts in the country until 05:00 on Saturday as many of the power plant units broke down on Monday and are under repair. The power cuts, called Stage 2 load-shedding in South Africa, started from 17:00 on Monday. Under Stage 2 load-shedding, almost 2 000 MW of power generation capacity is off the grid leading to at least two hours of power cut daily at a pre-determined time.
