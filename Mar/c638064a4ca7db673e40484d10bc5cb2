Trade union Solidarity has said it will lay charges of corruption, theft, fraud and mismanagement of State funds against 19 alleged State capturers, including former president Jacob Zuma, at the Brooklyn Police Station on Tuesday. Solidarity chief executive Dr Dirk Hermann said the criminal charges follow the reports and recommendations by the State capture commission, led by Justice Raymond Zondo which revealed how State funds were misused for personal gains. Solidarity says the charges focus on the institutions and people that caused major damage to workers and to its members, and include former South African Airways chairperson Dudu Myeni, former Transnet and Eskom head Brian Molefe, former Denel chairperson Daniel Mantsha, and former Denel chief executive Zwelakhe Ntsepe.
