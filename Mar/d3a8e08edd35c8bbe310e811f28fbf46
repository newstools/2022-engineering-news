Agriculture business organisation Agbiz has appointed Wolfe Braude fruit desk manager as of April as part of a joint initiative between Agbiz and fruit producer association Fruit South Africa (SA). The fruit desk is funded jointly by the South African Table Grape Industry, the Citrus Growers’ Association, the Fresh Produce Exporters’ Forum and Hortgro. Agbiz CEO Theo Boshoff says Braude brings with him expertise and experience on, besides other matters, trade and agricultural policy and international governance. “[Braude’s] experience will greatly contribute to strengthening the role of the Agbiz fruit desk in establishing effective partnerships with government and other interest groups to ensure opportunities in the fruit industry are maximised.” Braude previously worked at the National Labour and Economic Development Institute, the South African Sugar Association and Emet Consulting, as an analyst. His experience includes work on sugarcane-derived ethanol markets, support for the development of the South African chemicals sector strategy, new business and stakeholder management at the South African Institute of International Affairs and research on Agribusiness Chambers of Commerce in Africa for Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (known locally as the GIZ) and the New Partnership for Africa's Development. “I welcome the opportunity to add both continuity and value to the efforts of Agbiz to support and strengthen members, and specifically the fruit sector. I firmly believe the dynamic South African agricultural sector retains the potential for further growth and I look forward to supporting the realisation of this,” says Braude. Fruit SA CEO Fhumulani Ratshitanga says the fruit desk is an important resource for Fruit SA and the association looks forward to benefiting from Braude’s expertise to ensure that the fruit industry continues to grow and thrive. “On behalf of Fruit SA, I also wish him success in his role.”
