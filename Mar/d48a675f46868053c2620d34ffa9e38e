Cabinet has approved the One-Stop Border Post Policy and its implementation strategy, a post-Cabinet statement issued on March 25 notes. The policy seeks to harmonise the movement of people and goods between South Africa’s land ports of entry and neighbouring countries. Also, it gives effect to the One-Stop Border Framework that was adopted by Cabinet in 2018. The application of the policy will alleviate current congestion at the country’s land ports of entry for cross-border travellers and traders. These interventions are also noted as key in the country’s efforts in driving the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement. Once fully operationalised with relevant legislation and infrastructure upgrades, Cabinet envisages that the processing of goods, vehicles and people will be done in a seamless and faster manner.
