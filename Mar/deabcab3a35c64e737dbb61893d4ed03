Professional society the African Astronomical Society (AfAS) will host its second yearly scientific conference and general assembly in Cape Town, on March 14, with the aim of intensifying the growth of astronomy in Africa. The week-long hybrid event will focus on science, outreach, communication and education astronomy activities in Africa, as well as on enhancing further collaboration among countries in Africa and the rest of the world. The building of astronomy projects and initiatives, such as the Square Kilometre Array, the 32 m radio astronomy telescope in Ghana and the proposed Africa Millimetre Telescope, will also feature during the conference. The AfAS is a pan-African professional society of astronomers, which focuses on strengthening astronomy activities in Africa, particularly in terms of infrastructure, flagship projects and initiatives to grow human capital in astronomy, particularly youth and women. The AfAS conference will include planetarium shows, science education activities to attract young people, as well as the African Women in Astronomy Awards (AfNWA) that will showcase leading African female senior astronomers and early-career astronomers. The AfNWA connects women working in the astronomy sector and promotes future participation of girls and women in the sector. Organised in partnership with the Department of Science and Innovation, the Office of Astronomy for Development and South African Astronomical Observatory, the conference is expected to attract 250 participants. Meanwhile, the last day of the conference will see the election of the new executive committee of the general assembly of the AfAS.
