State-owned Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) has received reports that security guards employed by a third-party company to guard Transnet property in the Richards Bay Junction area and surrounds were allegedly involved in a confrontation with two men. The two men were allegedly captured by the guards and shot. "One of the young men managed to escape and is currently being treated in hospital, while the other was fatally wounded. A case has been opened with the South African Police Service in Mtuba. "TFR views these allegations in a very serious light and trusts that the full might of the law will be applied. The company appeals to the local community to allow the investigation to be concluded and not take the law into their own hands. "TFR extends its condolences to the family of the deceased and wishes a speedy and complete recovery to the injured," TFR says.
