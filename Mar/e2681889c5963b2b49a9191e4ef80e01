The KwaZulu-Natal provincial government has cemented a strategic partnership with the private sector to launch a training and skills development project that will prepare over 100 000 young people for the job market and entrepreneurship opportunities. The partnership between the provincial government and eLan Foundation’s Shift Africa Project, will also provide skills development for victims of gender-based violence and youth who have faced challenges like being in conflict with the law. The Shift Africa Project is part of the eLan Property Group's R16-billion Blythedale Coastal Estate Resort development. “The eLan Foundation and eLan Group have partnered with government to train young people and ensure they are employed at the property development project that will be implemented in the Ilembe district. “The Blythedale Coastal Estate Resort is a megaproject that will attract international investors . . . and result in the employment of more than 100 000 people during the construction phase and yield more business opportunities for small, medium-sized and microenterprises,” KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala comments.
