The first locally produced seventh-generation Isuzu D-Max bakkie has rolled off the production line at the Isuzu Motors South Africa (IMSAf) plant in Gqeberha. This signifies the beginning of commercial production of IMSAf’s soon-to-be-launched pickup, in an investment programme valued at R1.2-billion, first announced in 2019. “Isuzu’s Struandale plant and the new generation D-Max programme is crucial to the communities in the Nelson Mandela Bay metro and the livelihoods of thousands in South Africa and Africa,” says IMSAf president and CEO Billy Tom. The investment by the Japanese manufacturer means that IMSAf now boasts a new body shop at the Struandale manufacturing plant, a new chassis assembly line at the Kempston Road facility, as well as significant modifications to the paint shop and general assembly areas. “The new vehicle programme is dependent on more sophisticated tooling, technologies and increased automation, in line with technological advancements and improved efficiencies,” notes IMSAf technical operations senior VP Dominic Rimmer. In addition to preparing the facilities for the assembly of the new D-Max, Isuzu engineers have been rolling out a validation, homologation, and durability testing programme in preparation for the bakkie’s April introduction to the local market, as well as to markets in the rest of Africa later this year.
