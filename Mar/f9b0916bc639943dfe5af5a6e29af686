The KwaZulu-Natal executive council has approved the Provincial Cannabis Committee to oversee the development of the industry in the province. Premier Sihle Zikalala made the announcement on March 1. This follows shortly after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced during the State of the Nation Address that KwaZulu-Natal will lead in this new frontier of economic development. In his speech, Ramaphosa highlighted that the hemp and cannabis sector had the potential to create more than 130 000 new jobs and said that South Africans already had experience farming cannabis. The potential value of South Africa's cannabis and hemp industry is estimated at over R28-billion and could create between 10 000 and 20 000 job opportunities across the entire value-chain. Zikalala said the establishment of the cannabis industry would contribute to the diversification of the economy, create jobs, increase economic growth and contribute to poverty alleviation. The Provincial Cannabis Committee will be responsible for growing the cannabis and hemp industry through ensuring adherence to regulatory systems, seed supply systems, research and technology development. It will also drive the sustainable producer systems, market development supplier development systems, manufacturing and product development, education and training. According to the World Health Organisation, South Africa is the third-largest illegal cannabis producer in the world already, with about 2 500 t grown a year. The Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development recently released a Draft Cannabis Master Plan, which is aimed at ensuring the industry is viable. Included in the master plan’s list of priorities is the signing of the Cannabis for Private Purposes Bill into law within the 2022/23 financial year.
