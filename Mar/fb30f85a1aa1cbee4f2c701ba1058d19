South African National Parks (SANParks) says it has identified an exciting new pipeline of more than 100 new public-private partnership (PPP) opportunities for implementation over the next decade. Acting CEO Dumisani Dlamini says further details will be revealed during the upcoming Tourism Investment Summit on March 31. Dlamini notes that SANParks has developed a portfolio of 60 PPP projects since 2000. “The portfolio encompasses a diversity of tourism offerings ranging from adventure activities, retail and restaurants to accommodation. Cumulatively, these projects have contributed over R1.39-billion to SANParks in the last two decades, while increasing infrastructure assets to the value of R955-million. “The portfolio of PPPs has contributed significantly to the diversification of tourism offerings in the 20 national parks, as well as to tourism revenue as the key driver of conservation funding and the sustainability of SANParks," he adds.
