Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) says the mop-up phase for the 2022 census started on March 24 and will continue until April 14. During the mop-up phase, fieldworkers will visit all incomplete enumeration areas to count all households that were not counted during the first phase of data collection. The main phase of data collection for Census 2022 came to an end on March 20. Just more than 12-million households, from an estimated 17.4-million households, have been counted. More than 70% of households in Limpopo, Mpumalanga and the Free State have completed the census, while only 30% of households in the Western Cape have completed the census. Households that have not been counted are advised to wait to be contacted by a fieldworker. Households that have not registered before and wish to opt for online completion can only register with the assistance of a fieldworker. Online registration will not reopen, Stats SA stated. “Households that registered for online questionnaire completion before, but failed to complete the questionnaire within the allocated time, will be re-sent the questionnaire completion link. Households are requested to adhere to the communicated timelines for questionnaire completion.” “We appeal to everyone who has not been counted to use this opportunity to exercise their civic duty to participate in the census,” says South Africa statistician-general Risenga Maluleke.
