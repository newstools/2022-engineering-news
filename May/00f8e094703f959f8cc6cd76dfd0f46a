Water utility Rand Water is scheduling a shutdown of its H12 pipeline from June 3 to 4 in a 39.5-hour project to tie in a 5.2-km-long section of the newly built 1.7-m-diameter H39 pipeline. The implementation of the project will require that the existing H12 pipeline be isolated on June 3 from 07:00. The system is expected to be fully restored by 22:30 on June 4. Rand Water has informed the affected municipal customer, Johannesburg Water by issuing a 21-day notice to enable the customer to execute appropriate contingency plans. During the shutdown, water users may experience a 50% reduction in water supply, while the system is expected to take about two to three days to adequately recover after supply has been fully restored. As such, Rand Water has advised Johannesburg Water to fill its reservoirs before the actual shutdown starts, with the north-western areas and Randjesfontein likely to be affected by the shutdown. Nonetheless, Rand Water appeals to consumers to use water sparingly during the affected dates. The new section of the H39 pipeline is designed to augment a portion of the H12 pipeline. The new pipeline has been laid along the route adjacent to the existing H12 pipeline within the Rand Water registered servitude at the point of the tie-in – which will take place in Glen Austin, Midrand, inside the Randjesfontein Estate.
