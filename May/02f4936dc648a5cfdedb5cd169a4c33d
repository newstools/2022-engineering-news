The South African National Roads Agency Limited on May 11 advised that only one lane was open on the N3 southbound after the Key Ridge interchange after a sinkhole formed, causing major traffic congestion from Peacevale to the Hammarsdale interchange, in KwaZulu-Natal. “Two lanes, including the shoulder lane, have been cordoned off with barriers and only one traffic lane is open,” said Sanral eastern region operations and maintenance manager Dudley Mbambo. The sinkhole is the result of the torrential rains in the province in April, which caused the soil to erode from underneath. “Motorists are advised to approach Key Ridge Interchange cautiously and plan their trips accordingly. Our engineers are on scene to assess the situation and start with repair works,” said Mbambo.
