The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) has committed over R12-million towards the resurfacing of the M2 motorway. The three-pronged project entails the resurfacing of the M2 motorway Eastbound, Cleveland off-ramp and on-ramp and the M2 motorway Westbound from New Gorch road to Maritzburg off-ramp south of the Johannesburg central business district, and is scheduled to be completed by June 30. The section of the M2 motorway where the aforementioned road works will be conducted is located in the Cleveland suburb of Johannesburg. The three undertakings form part of the JRA’s Integrated Development Plan and are also aligned to the City of Johannesburg Mayoral Priority 1, which is intended to promote economic development through attracting investments that are envisaged to contribute 5% economic growth to the city’s economy. The identified routes were prioritised by the JRA’s Road Asset Management System planning department after rigorous consultations with regional operations depot managers and other critical stakeholders as per the JRA’s Strategic Pillar Guidelines aimed at ensuring the assurance of services to the public, the agency points out. The resurfacing of the roads will entail milling out 120 mm of the surfacing on all poor condition sections, which will involve the verification of the milling depth during construction in line with the approved budget. Moreover, the work will include repairing localised pavement failures and crack sealing; inlaying milled sections with an 80 mm bitumen-treated base; overlaying 40 mm asphalt throughout the road; and road marking. Upon conclusion of the project, 5.60 lane kilometres of roads would have been resurfaced. The project’s scope does not include kerbs, permanent road signs, sidewalks and drains.
