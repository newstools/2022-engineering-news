The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) will approve its yearly percentage guideline increase and review municipal tariff benchmarks at a public hearing on May 13. This follows the publication of a consultation paper on March 30 on the review of the municipal tariff guideline increase, benchmarks and proposed timelines for the 2022/23 municipal tariff approval process. The guideline increase assists municipalities in the preparation of their budgets, while the revised benchmarks are used in the evaluation of the municipal tariff applications. This process is dependent on the approval of State-owned utility Eskom’s revenues and retail tariff structural adjustment (ERTSA). On February 28, Eskom submitted its ERTSA application for the 2022/23 financial year, together with the schedule of standard tariffs, for approval. This was approved by Nersa on March 9. Anyone wishing to attend or present their views at the public hearing must submit their request to publichearings@nersa.org.za by 15:30 on May 12. The consultation document is available on Nersa’s website.
