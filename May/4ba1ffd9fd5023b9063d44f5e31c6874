Mozambican President Filipe Jacinto Nyusi last week inaugurated 1 058 m of rehabilitated berthing area – comprising berths 6, 7, 8 and 9 – at the Port of Maputo. The berths, rehabilitated, expanded and dredged to depths of up to –16 m, are now fully operational, allowing the port to receive and load an increasing number of bigger vessels (capesize). In his inaugural speech, Nyusi noted that an increase in shipments would mean more revenue and income for Mozambicans. “These berths are a fundamental pillar for implementing the master plan launched in 2010, approved by the Government of Mozambique,” added Maputo Port Development Company (MPDC) CEO Osório Lucas. “They are also the foundation of the new masterplan that we presented publicly yesterday.” Plans for the port include construction of a new berth for bulk cargo; the creation of a food terminal (grains, sugar, vegetable oils, molasses); the expansion of the container terminal; the expansion of the intermodal container terminal; and the expansion of Grindrod’s TCM (drybulk) capacity to 12-million tons a year. Lucas reinforced that it is essential to align investment throughout the corridor. “We will continue to work with CFM [Mozambique’s State-owned ports and railways company] and Transnet to achieve a better balance between road and rail freight, promoting an integrated development that will further enhance the corridor’s growth.”
