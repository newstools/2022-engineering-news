Water utility Rand Water will conduct maintenance at the Vereeniging Water Treatment Plant, and power utility City Power will do maintenance of the electrical systems that feed Rand Water’s Eikenhof pump station from June 3 to 4. This will leave Johannesburg, Merafong, Randwest, Mogale City and Rustenburg without water for the 24-hour period, Rand Water said on  May 27. Rand Water will tie-in the newly installed F46 pipeline to the existing F34 pipeline and install a new non-return valve on a pump-set at Vereeniging Water Treatment Plant. "Rand Water agreed with City Power to undertake all water and electricity maintenance on the 3rd of June 2022 until the 4th of June 2022 as per Rand Water’s plan," the water utility said. The duration of the maintenance work will be 24 hours. Rand Water will start pumping water immediately upon completion of this maintenance work, it added. However, the system restoration timelines will be communicated by the affected municipalities to their consumers. "Rand Water would like to appeal to consumers to continue using water sparingly."
