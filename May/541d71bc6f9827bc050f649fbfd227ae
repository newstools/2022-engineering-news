The City of Johannesburg’s Department of Economic Development has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Institute for Information Technology Professionals South Africa (IITPSA) to collaborate on information and communication technology (ICT) sector development and digital skills development initiatives. The three-year agreement, signed at Tlhabogolo Opportunity Centre in Diepsloot, aligns with the department’s vision for the city to be a leading destination in the development, growth and promotion of the ICT ecosystem. The department has committed to developing and implementing measures to create an environment conducive to ICT sector growth across the city. IITPSA will support the City of Johannesburg as it raises awareness of the city as a smart investment destination, supporting learning and working from home initiatives, particularly for excluded communities and offering advice and support on ICT sector skills strategies. The MoU is IITPSA’s first formal agreement with the city, said IITPSA nonexecutive director Thabo Mashegoane. “It is a significant moment, and marks the start of closer collaboration, and what we hope will be a long and productive relationship,” he said, adding that IITPSA was ready to support Johannesburg’s Smart City and skills development initiatives. “It is always beneficial to collaborate with strategic knowledge generation partners, such as the IITPSA, to leverage on their intellectual capital and expertise to enhance service delivery in the city. “We are excited about this partnership as it will bring much-needed digital skills across the city, and support our priority to make Joburg a smart and business-friendly city,” said City of Johannesburg Economic Development MMC Councillor Nkuli Mbundu.
