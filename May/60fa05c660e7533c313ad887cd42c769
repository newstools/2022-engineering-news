The Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA) has launched procurement activities for a Programme Management Unit (PMU) for management, oversight and reporting during implementation of Phase II of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP). Bidding documents are expected to be advertised shortly for the services to start in early 2023. With the evolution of the project from advance infrastructure to the upcoming main works construction and the expiration of the current PMU contract, LHDA said in an update that it is necessary to procure a new PMU contract. By mutual agreement, the current PMU lead, CDM Smith, will not bid for this contract; however, there will be a period of transition to facilitate smooth handover from the old to the new PMU. The engineering main works component comprises the Polihali dam, the 38 km Polihali Transfer Tunnel and the 80 MW Oxbow Hydropower. Most of the advance infrastructure is nearing completion in time for the main works to start. The environmental and social programmes are ongoing. The Polihali dam to be constructed in Lesotho under LHWP Phase II will increase the volume of water transferred to South Africa from the current supply rate of 780-million cubic metres a year to about 1 270-million cubic metres a year, while simultaneously increasing the electricity generated at the Muela hydropower plant.
