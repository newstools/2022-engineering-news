Packaging group Nampak expects to report headline earnings per share (HEPS) of between 33c and 36.5c for the six months ended March 31. This is an improvement of between 91% and 109% year-on-year, which the company attributes to improved trading conditions and lower net devaluation losses arising from exchange rate movements in the rest of Africa. HEPS in the prior comparable period were 17.6c. Notably, there were also no significant impairments or reversal of impairments in the first half of Nampak’s 2022 financial year. Earnings per share (EPS) are expected to be between 32.5c and 35.5c, compared with EPS of 17c posted for the six months ended March 31, 2021. Nampak will release its interim results on or about May 26.
