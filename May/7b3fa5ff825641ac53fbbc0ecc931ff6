Pan-African network operator Paratus has started deploying the first independent fibre infrastructure in Gaborone’s central business district This step in providing businesses with critical connectivity follows three years of planning the deployment of fibre infrastructure across Botswana. Paratus has invested heavily in independent fibre connectivity in Botswana as a seamless add-on to its existing infrastructure backbone, with services including national and international network services, Internet, voice, satellite, structured cabling and hosting solutions. “By investing in fibre in Gaborone, Paratus Botswana is connecting critical areas in the city. The current deployment is the second phase, distributing fibre in all the major business and industrial areas in Gaborone and malls in the area,” the company said in a statement. Paratus boasts 100% independent international connectivity in Botswana and the latest fibre services will bolster the ever-increasing bandwidth and uptime requirements for businesses and allow for the delivery of uninterrupted services. “Paratus is aligned with the government’s Botswana Vision 2036. With the aim of transforming Botswana from an upper-middle-income country to a high-income country, we are working hard to help unleash unlimited growth and upliftment,” said Paratus Botswana country MD Shawn Bruwer. “Critically, the investment in fibre in Botswana is strategically important in further securing Botswana as a hub in the Southern African region. We are also, of course, closely working in line with Paratus group’s ambitious expansion plan throughout Africa.” The group’s vision is to transform Africa through exceptional digital infrastructure and customer service, with ambitions of doubling revenue within the next five years. “Our plan for expansion and growth is through investing and deploying the best infrastructure, as well as through mergers and acquisitions,” said Paratus executive chairperson Barney Harmse.
