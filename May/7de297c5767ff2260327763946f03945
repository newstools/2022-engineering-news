Telecommunications group MTN South Africa is investing R2.2-billion into its 2022 network modernisation programme in Gauteng to meet demand, maintain network excellence and extend reach into township areas. MTN’s countrywide modernisation of network South Africa, or Monza, project – 68% of which has already been completed nationally – will see 1 350 sites set to be finalised during the year, with around 200 key regions covered across South Africa. “Gauteng remains South Africa’s economic hub, with half of all national fifth-generation (5G) traffic generated from the province. MTN also saw a 45% increase year-on-year in data volume growth in February,” said MTN South Africa Gauteng operations GM Keith Tukei. “We are therefore making numerous strategic investments to enhance access, availability modernisation and boost the rollout of solutions into rural areas.” MTN is expanding on its 555 5G sites in Gauteng and adding 20 5G sites in the Rustenburg and Brits areas in the North West. “Our investment will continue to drive the rollout of 5G to enable seamless, fast and cutting-edge experience online. We expect to see Gauteng continuing to lead the drive for 5G and other business-focused innovations such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and augmented reality grow,” Tukei added. The investment will enable MTN to increase its network coverage, improve throughputs and customer experience in the region, as well as mitigate battery theft and vandalism, which remains a key priority for the company in 2022. “The consistent theft of batteries and vandalism at network towers remains a major threat to all networks across South Africa, and Gauteng is no exception.” Some R30-million has been set aside to help limit the direct damage in Gauteng. The funds will be allocated to ad hoc repairs, general repairs, fibre repairs and vandalism mitigation.
