DP World Maputo says it has successfully handled its first citrus reefer export of the 2022 season. Through a combination of new solutions, including a direct sailing service, DP World hopes to position itself as the “ideal gateway” for the South African citrus industry exporting to the Middle East and Southeast Asia. The South African citrus growing region located just across the Mozambique border produces more than 50 000 forty foot equivalent units over a six-month season, making the region the world’s second-largest citrus exporter in 2020. “Finding efficient ways to export our highly in-demand fresh produce, such as citrus, has been a top priority at the Port of Maputo,” says DP World Maputo CEO Christian Roeder. “Southern African fruit farmers are discovering the advantages of shorter transit times through our secure, efficient, and end-to-end logistics solutions via the Port of Maputo. This means serious savings on time and money for local farmers, with better exposure to international markets.”
