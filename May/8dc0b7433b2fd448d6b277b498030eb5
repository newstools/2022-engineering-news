JSE-listed York Timber says some employees of the company, affiliated with union the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa), embarked on a strike at York’s Escarpment operations on April 25. The strike notice contained only one matter of mutual interest relating to job grading, York notes. An independent senior commissioner of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration was engaged to oversee the job grading process. The process was in an advanced stage when Numsa exited the process and issued a strike notice. The grading report was delivered by the senior commissioner on May 5, York outlines. “Striking employees have not abided by the picketing rules, despite the company obtaining an urgent interdict to enforce adherence thereof on May 4. [The] Escarpment operations were disrupted significantly, with certain Numsa members inciting acts of intimidation, harassment and vandalism. “As a result, the company is prevented from accessing and operating at its Escarpment facilities,” York states. On May 11, the Labour Court issued an interim court order declaring the strike unprotected. York says it will accordingly proceed with disciplinary action against relevant employees in accordance with the Labour Relations Act. The strike is expected to have a negative impact on the company’s operations and production. York’s Escarpment operations contributed 51% to total group revenue for the financial year ended June 30, 2021. The company says it seeks to resolve the strike amicably and that it continues to meet with Numsa representatives in accordance with the framework set out in the recognition agreement entered into between the company and the union.
