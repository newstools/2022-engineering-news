Business organisation Business Unity South Africa (Busa) says in a statement that business has taken note of the report from Operation Vulindlela on the progress made in implementing some of the structural reforms required to attract investment and put the country on a path to sustained and inclusive economic growth. “Business has supported the work of Operation Vulindlela, and we consider this to be a successful bilateral arrangement between government and business to enable progress and implementation. "We believe Operation Vulindlela has done excellent work and we note the reforms marked as “completed” and also the excellent work done by Operation Vulindlela in this regard,” Busa states. However, it notes that Operation Vulindlela is not mandated to ensure different departments in government use the reforms to implement necessary actions to enable the private sector to drive business. It mentions the 100 MW licensing exemption ceiling for embedded generation projects as an example. “We welcomed the announcement by President [Cyril] Ramaphosa of the raising of the ceiling to 100 MW. "However, private sector generators of power are still being hampered by inappropriate processes and regulations [managed by] the National Energy Regulator of South Africa, which make it difficult to act on the reform. We find similar issues with the Critical Skills List and other reforms,” Busa points out. It says the issue is, therefore, the capability and commitment of government departments to eliminate the red tape hampering business leveraging off the reforms. Busa is in discussion with government on how it can help unblock implementation and cut red tape to attract investment, grow the economy and create sustainable jobs, it states.
