Cabinet has approved a new liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) rollout strategy for implementation. The strategy, which was published for public consultation in March, seeks to expand the domestic industry and contribute to the diversification of sources of energy, Minister in the Presidency Mondli Gungubele said on Thursday. “The strategy will amongst other interventions, regulate the pricing in the value chain and support the manufacturing of LPG cylinders in the country. “It will also educate the public about the benefits of using LPG as an alternative form of energy,” Gungubele said during a post-Cabinet briefing. The document could be accessed online at www.dmr.gov.za once it had been published by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy.
