A 50:50 joint venture (JV) between construction company Clough and technological and engineering firm Saipem has been awarded the engineering, procurement and construction contract for Perdaman Industries’ $2.7-billion urea plant in Western Australia. Clough is a wholly-owned subsidiary of JSE-listed engineering and contracting group Murray & Roberts (M&R). The scope of work includes engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of the 2.14-million-tonne-a-year urea plant, including all urea storage and loadout facilities, a water treatment plant, a 100 MW power plant, renewable power and 7 km of closed conveyor to the Pilbara port. Work on the project is expected to start during the third quarter of this year. Clough’s share of the contract value is about R22-billion, increasing M&R’s order book to an all-time high of about R80-billion. Upon award, this multiyear project will complement M&R’s significant order book and extend its secured revenue base into the medium to long term.
