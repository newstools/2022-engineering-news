Chemicals and energy multinational Sasol says it has completed the divestment of its shareholding in the 175 MW gas-to-power plant Central Térmica de Ressano Garcia (CTRG), in Ressano Garcia, Mozambique, effective April 29. In December 2020, Sasol announced that a sale securities purchase agreement had been signed with Azura Power for the divestment of Sasol’s equity interest in CTRG. All conditions precedent have now been fulfilled. "This transaction is part of the company’s ongoing strategy-aligned asset divestment programme announced in March 2020. “Sasol remains fully committed to upstream gas operations in Mozambique, which continues to be integral to Sasol’s strategy," the company says.
