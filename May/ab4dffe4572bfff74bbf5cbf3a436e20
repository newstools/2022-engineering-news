Lwazi Bam will step down as CEO of consultancy Deloitte Africa on May 31, after serving in the position for ten years. He will be succeeded by former chairperson Ruwayda Redfearn. Bam joined Deloitte in 1994 and became a partner of the firm in 2003. He had been due to finish his tenure as CEO at the end of his second term in May 2019; however, the firm requested him to extend his stay for an additional term. He says his biggest challenges in the last term include scrutiny on the profession and role of auditors and getting the company through the global Covid-19 pandemic unscathed. “Both these events have provided significant opportunities for changing how we conduct our business. They give us impetus to leapfrog several stages of development and accelerate our digital transformation journey. “The investments that we have made in audit quality, in growing our advisory business and our positioning in East and West Africa have equipped us well for the unfolding future,” Bam adds.
