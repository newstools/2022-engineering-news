South African customers can now order their Ineos Grenadier online, with the starting price for the base model set at R1.41-million. The vehicle launches as a five-seat sports-utility vehicle, with permanent four-wheel drive, two-speed transfer case and centre-locking differential included as standard. In addition to the standard specification Grenadier, Ineos Automotive also offers two preconfigured vehicle editions. The Grenadier Trialmaster and Fieldmaster Editions have both been curated with specific purposes in mind and are built to take on the outdoors. The Trialmaster edition has been specified with extreme off-roading in mind, while the Fieldmaster edition is for those with a more sporty lifestyle who will use their vehicle to get them and their kit to wherever they want to go. An online configurator at ineosgrenadier.com takes customers through the build of their Grenadier, step-by-step, with a host of extras and options available. The site also offers vehicle price updates in real time, with the price shown on the configurator to be the price customers will pay for their Grenadiers. Once customers have settled on their specific configuration, they will be able to choose their collection location, with an interactive map showing the nearest retailer. A deposit of R40 000, refundable until the vehicle contract is signed, secures a build slot. South African owners get a five year/100 000 km warranty. In all global markets the Grenadier comes with a three-year paint warranty, a three-year warranty for accessories, while the ladder-frame chassis and body components have a 12-year antiperforation warranty.
