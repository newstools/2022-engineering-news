The South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) has started with the construction of a temporary detour route near the N2 in uMkhomazi and Umgababa in the north of Durban. This will allow flow of traffic from the south to the north of Durban, which has been blocked since the floods in April. Sanral expects the detour will be completed by May 6. KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala says Sanral will soon provide information on work to repair damaged roads in the province. “As we continue with the task of rebuilding our province, we can say with certainty that most of road access is now open. Traffic is flowing. While there are still delays, this is temporary as our teams do their best to return us to normality,” he adds. In the meantime, Sanral has suspended the payment of toll fees at the oThongathi and Mvoti toll plazas on the N2 to assist communities affected by the closure of alternative roads that were damaged in the floods. Further, while water and electricity have been restored in many areas, some areas in both urban and rural areas are still experiencing irregular or no running water. Water provision continues to improve although areas such as Nagina, Clarewater, Ntshongweni, Ntshangwe and Zwelibomvu are still without water. With regard to electricity, the eThekwini municipality is still facing challenges in reconnecting power to numerous areas. The Premier reassured that technicians had been working unceasingly to bring back power. “Government is attending to all service delivery complaints that are being reported and we urge community members to be patient and desist from blockading roads as this delays the full restoration of services.”
