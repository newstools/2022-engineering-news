Citizen services platform My Smart City (MSC), developed by software company Acumen Software, has won the Brand South Africa (SA) Social Cohesion Award and has been onboarded as a Play Your Part Ambassador by Brand SA. "The award shows that Acumen Software's innovative development of the citizen-centred platform has risen to the challenges and opportunities facing South Africa's metropolitan centres. “This platform gives South Africans a real voice in resolving service delivery issues, removing citizen frustration and promoting trust and accountability for the municipality," says Acumen Software marketing head Terence Rei. "We developed the MSC platform to give citizens a voice. We are thrilled that this voice carries across the nation and that privately funded initiatives like this get the recognition they deserve. Well done to the MSC team. “Thank you, Brand SA, for recognising the importance of using tech to effect change," comments Acumen Software COO Kennedy Mogotsi. My Smart City has created a thriving ecosystem where citizens stand together and effect change in their cities through 'crowd pushing.' The goal is to relieve service delivery frustrations for citizens by streamlining workflows through innovative and user-friendly technology. More than 27 000 citizens are tracking their logged issues in real-time from the My Smart City platform. This crowd pushing effect generates action and meaningful change.
