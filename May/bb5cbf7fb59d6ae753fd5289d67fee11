Indian truck manufacturer Ashok Leyland has announced a distribution partnership with ETG Logistics (ETGL), which will include ETGL operating Ashok Leyland dealerships in six countries in Southern Africa. The agreement will cover countries such as Zambia, South Africa and Mozambique. ETG is a global conglomerate operating across various markets, with its ETGL vertical an automotive and farm equipment distribution business active in South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Swaziland, Botswana, Tanzania, Zambia, Mozambique and Kenya. “We have ambitious growth plans for the African market,” says Ashok Leyland international operations head Amandeep Singh. “Our time-tested products are well suited for the African terrain and offer a superior value proposition. ETG group’s extensive connections in these markets will complement our growth plans.” Ashok Leyland is already present in most East and West African countries. ETGL CEO Rajeev Saxena believes the new partnership will be instrumental in providing “a range of commercial vehicle solutions to address the specific requirements of different customer groups in the territory”. The Ashok Leyland trucks to enter the Southern African market range from small 1.5 t payload movers to 20 t tucks and tippers, notes ETGL South Africa business head Pavankumar Nair. ETGL is currently engaged with the process to meet the local compliance requirements on the range of Ashok Leyland vehicles to be introduced locally, and “should be able to start sales in South Africa in July”. Sales in the rest of Southern Africa “will start soon”, says Nair. He adds that Ashok Leyland is a familiar name in the region, as the brand has a presence in the specialised defence vehicle market and, to some extent, commercial vehicles that arrived as special projects.
