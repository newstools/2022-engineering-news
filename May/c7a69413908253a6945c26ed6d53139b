Telecommunications group MTN is investing R624-million to upgrade and deploy new network infrastructure across the Eastern Cape this year. The investment forms part of MTN’s ‘Modernisation of Network South Africa’, or Monza, project to expand network reach into rural communities, drive 5G expansion and work to restore vandalised network infrastructure. “We are working across the country to modernise the entire MTN network. Just over 68% has already been completed nationally, and the Eastern Cape is our next focus area,” said MTN South Africa Eastern Cape GM Maria Soares van Niekerk. “While we have invested in improving data speeds and connections in the short term, this plan is longer-term in nature, securing resilience, stability, quality and helping us expand our reach significantly.” The company currently provides coverage to over 98% of the population in the Eastern Cape province and the project will increase this network coverage, improve throughputs, and elevate customer experience. MTN is planning to focus on 491 towers as part of its network resilience and optimisation programme, this will see various areas receive increased coverage and capacity. Network modernisation across 187 sites is already 68% complete and largely focused on East London, Mthatha and the Queenstown sub-region. MTN will also extend its fifth-generation (5G) connectivity across the region, with another 18 5G sites planned for 2022, adding to the current 94 live 5G sites. “A key determinant of the success of the MTN modernisation project, however, is the ongoing problem of battery theft and tower vandalism,” said Soares van Niekerk. “Across the region, 45% of sites in Queenstown sub-region and 44% of sites in Mthatha sub-region will therefore get new batteries to improve network resilience in 2022. This is over and above the R650-million invested in 2021, with 2 600 base station batteries replaced nationally.”
