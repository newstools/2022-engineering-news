JSE-listed property development company Calgro M3 has signed an exclusive agreement with funeral application (app) developer Sendoff, which aims to digitise the experience of arranging and managing funerals. Under the terms of the agreement, Calgro's five memorial parks – three in Gauteng and two in Cape Town – listed on the app. The app, launched in May 2021, was built to digitise the entire process of organising a funeral, says Sendoff CEO Zolani Matebese. “From arranging for a loved one to be picked up from a home, hospice or hospital once they have passed on, to choosing a casket or urn, flowers, transport and catering, you can do everything via Sendoff, all from the convenience of your smartphone or computer,” he says. The partnership with Calgro is strategically important because it moves Sendoff closer to the goal of ensuring every part of the funeral services value chain is available on the app, he adds. “We are very excited to team up with Sendoff, which gives people the ability to plan a funeral online. This is thinking outside of the box, which appeals to Calgro,” says Calgro Memorial Parks MD Waldi Joubert. “The convenience of this offering is something that has not been offered previously, and will appeal to a range of individuals, including those who do not have family members to assist with such planning, or who don’t perhaps want to rely on others for such help. The ease of use is also attractive in today’s increasingly online world, and where time is often a factor,” he adds. “Users can view and order a private grave or memorial completely online and in the palm of your hand,” says Sendoff COO Thabisile Sethaba. “We promise our users a better way of organising a funeral and South African families looking for a more secure, serene and beautiful final resting place for their loved ones,” she says.
