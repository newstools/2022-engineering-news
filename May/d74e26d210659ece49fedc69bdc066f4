The Standard Bank Group (SBG) has appointed Nonkululeko Nyembezi chairperson-designate for SBG and Standard Bank of South Africa (SBSA), effective June 1. The appointment follows a robust succession planning process that was led by the group’s lead independent director Trix Kennealy. Nyembezi was appointed as an independent nonexecutive director of SBG and SBSA in January 2020. Her previous roles include chairperson of the JSE and Alexander Forbes Group Holdings, as well as nonexecutive director of Old Mutual and Standard Bank Namibia and CEO of ArcelorMittal South Africa. She also holds a chairperson position at Business Leadership South Africa and often represents corporate South Africa at international investment conferences. SBG CE Sim Tshabalala says Nyembezi is the ideal candidate for chairperson, with a strong academic background, great achievements as an industrialist and corporate leader and with a worldwide network of peers.
