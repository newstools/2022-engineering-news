Owing to the lower weekend demand, load-shedding will be reduced to Stage 1 from 22:00 on Friday, Eskom has announced. Load-shedding will continue at that level until 05:00 on Monday. "While the return to service of generation units has been rather slow, it is possible to reduce the stage of load-shedding during the weekend. Eskom will continue to monitor the system and implement any changes as required. "Since yesterday morning a generation unit each at Matla, Hendrina and Arnot power stations have returned to service. "At the same time, however, a generation unit at Kendal, Kusile and Matimba power stations were either taken offline or tripped. Further, delays in returning generators to service at Arnot, Kendal and three units at Tutuka power stations have added to the capacity constraints," Eskom says.
