The South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) says it has deployed construction teams to start with immediate work on the N12 in Potchefstroom, Klerksdorp and Wolmaransstad in the North West province. In March, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula instructed the roads agency to act rapidly to address the challenge of potholes and the parts of the N12 that are in an undesirable state. Sanral northern regional manager Progress Hlahla says the agency has deployed construction teams and specialists to attend to the matter as quickly as possible. “Following the Minister’s call, we have mobilised a rapid response team to deal with the identified issues on the network. We have also mobilised our routine road maintenance (RRM) teams and the existing contractors in the vicinity of the N12 to go and assist,” he notes. Although the identified parts of the network fall under the jurisdiction of the North West provincial government, Sanral was appointed as an agent for it to carry out the required repair work. Sanral says it embraced this role as it has an even greater mandate and responsibility to deliver quality roads for the benefit of all citizens and to promote the free and safe movement of goods and people. Hlahla notes that, once the work has been completed, the pothole challenges will be negated and the challenge of drainage will be addressed, leaving a much newer, safer road which the citizens can enjoy and be proud of. “We are an agency at work for our people and we will continue to update the public on further developments and progress of the projects. Ours is a greater task of delivering a good quality road network system and we look forward to partnering with South Africans to achieve this for the foreseeable future,” he states.
