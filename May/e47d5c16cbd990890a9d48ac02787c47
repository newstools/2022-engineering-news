South African National Parks (SANParks) will invest R370-million in infrastructure upgrades and refurbishments at the Kruger National Park (KNP) over the next three years.

Funds for the upgrade have been accumulated from payments from insurers and contributions from the Department of Tourism; however, the biggest portion of funding comes from an infrastructure development programme allocation to SANParks from the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment. Projects prioritised for this year include the rebuilding of the burnt Letaba shop and fencing and the Lower Sabie petrol station, which was also destroyed by fire. Construction of the Shingwedzi main building roof, which had been removed due to termites, will also be completed.

The upgrade further covers Phase 1 of the Phalaborwa Wildlife Activity Hub, as well as the renovation and upgrade of more than 110 tourism accommodation units at camps across the Park.

The Skukuza camps will also receive an upgrade after being impacted by termites.

The first phase of the programme will provide important impetus to upgrading infrastructure and improving visitor experience.

“We are currently finalising contracts and works packages with successful contractors for civil and building works and this should be completed by the end of May. “Contractors will move on site during May and June and we will start seeing the results of these investments in the second half of 2022,” says KNP managing executive Gareth Coleman.
