New-vehicle sales, although dented by the impact of the recent floods in KwaZulu-Natal, managed to remain in positive territory in April, says Naamsa | The Automotive Business Council. Domestic new-vehicle sales in April increased by 4.3%, to 37 107 units, compared with the same month last year. The new-passenger-car market reached 26 653 units in April – a 12.9% jump on the same month last year, with the car rental industry accounting for 12.5% of car sales. In stark contrast to this, the sale of new bakkies, vans and minibus taxis declined by 11.9%, to 9 558 units. April medium-truck sales dropped by 9.4%, reaching 475 units, while heavy-truck and bus sales declined by 4.6%, to 1 421 units. New-vehicle exports from South Africa delivered some cheer, improving by 16%, to 30 788 units. Year-to-date vehicle exports are now 2.7% above the level of the corresponding period last year. The April floods caused severe supply chain disruptions in port, rail and road traffic, as well as the temporary closure of the Toyota South Africa Motors plant in Durban, says Naamsa. The industry body says the shock of the disaster “will be felt for some time to come”. “The domestic automotive industry is expected to continue a stop-start recovery in 2022 in view of prevailing Covid-19-related supply chain disruptions, insufficient stock, and escalating energy and transportation cost increases,” Naamsa adds.
