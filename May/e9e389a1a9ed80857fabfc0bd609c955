State-owned logistics and freight agency Transnet has welcomed the 20-year sentence handed down by the Harrismith Regional Court for a 42-year-old man found guilty of tampering with essential infrastructure and stealing diesel. He was arrested for stealing diesel from Transnet’s Multiproduct Pipeline, near Harrismith, in May 2020. "The sentence sends a strong message to other perpetrators that the dedicated team from the security task teams, the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation (the Hawks), the South African Police Service (SAPS) Crime Intelligence, the State Security Agency, the National Prosecuting Authority and local SAPS will ensure all offenders who tamper or collude to tamper with the pipeline will be charged and prosecuted," Transnet said. Further, the successful conviction is an indication that intelligence and surveillance task teams, as well as the joint ventures with other key role-players dedicated to fighting this scourge of fuel theft, is paying off. To date, 173 suspects have been arrested and seven successful convictions have been secured. "Transnet continues to urge all petroleum retailers and members of the public to refrain from buying fuel from unregistered traders to curb the demand for illegal petroleum products." It also calls on all its stakeholders to join in the fight against petroleum theft by reporting any suspicious trucks, bakkies, tankers or activity near the company’s infrastructure by calling the Transnet Pipelines toll free number 0800 203 843, or reporting the matter to the nearest SAPS station.
