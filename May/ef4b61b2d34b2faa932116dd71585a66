Power utility Eskom has announced that it will implement Stage 2 load-shedding from 17:00 on May 3 to 05:00 on Monday, May 9. The utility attributed the load-shedding to a shortage of generation capacity owing to delays in returning generators to service, as well as breakdowns of nine generators. Since May 2, a generation unit each at Lethabo, Tutuka, Ingula, Drakensberg, Arnot, as well as two units each at Hendrina and Matla power stations suffered breakdowns. Further, delays in returning generators to service at Arnot, Kendal and three units at Tutuka power stations have added to the capacity constraints. "Eskom expects to return as many of these units to service as possible over the next few days. We also expect to rely on the use of emergency generating reserves to limit the stage of loadshedding during this period," Eskom said. It currently has 3 875 MW on planned maintenance, while another 15 067 MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns.
