The South African Navy has taken delivery of the first of three multi-mission inshore patrol vessels at its naval dockyard in Simon's Town, Cape Town. The vessel formed part of Project Biro, which "aims to rejuvenate the South African Navy patrol capability" through the acquisition of the three patrol vessels, according to a statement by the navy. The vessels were expected to augment South Africa's maritime security by enhancing the country's capability to respond "effectively, rapidly, and cost-effectively" to threats such as illegal trafficking and poaching. The vessels form part of a drive by the SA Navy to "create a capability to build ships on the continent" instead of importing ships and parts. South Africa had previously relied on countries such as Germany to construct its ships, which meant parts had to be sourced from Europe, and paid for in foreign currency, often leading to delays. Damen Shipyards Cape Town was awarded the contract to build the vessels. "The construction of the [vessels] by Damen Shipyards affirms the South African shipbuilding capability to the global community and puts South Africa on the map in terms of its shipbuilding capacity," the statement said. The first vessel was handed over to Chief of the South African Navy, Vice Admiral Mosuwa Hlongwane, on Wednesday. South Africa had previously demonstrated its expertise by building the SAS Drakensberg, its largest naval vessel which was designed and built in Durban in 1984.
